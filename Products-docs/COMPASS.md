1. Executive Summary


COMPASS is the discovery and trend intelligence layer of the SILO supplement optimization platform. It empowers users to explore what’s trending in the world of supplementation by aggregating community usage insights, research findings, and product data into a single accessible interface. As one of SILO’s five core pillars, COMPASS complements the personalized regimen-building tools of VANTA Lab by guiding users on what supplements or protocols to consider, based on real-time trends and evidence, before they decide how to implement them. This pillar is must-ship for the platform’s initial release, ensuring that from day one users have a rich discovery experience to drive engagement and informed decision-making.


At its core, COMPASS offers a searchable database of supplements and protocols combined with an interactive “supplement card” system that delivers enriched insights (covering usage statistics, brand quality audits, scientific research, synergies, safety warnings, pricing, and more) in a concise view. Users – whether health enthusiasts, clinicians, brands, or researchers – can leverage COMPASS to identify trending supplement stacks, read editorial spotlights, and glean anonymized community intelligence without compromising privacy. This capability addresses a critical gap in the supplement industry: the lack of a trusted, data-driven resource for discovering what works for others and why, in real time. By integrating internal analytics, expert content, and external data feeds, COMPASS transforms disjointed information into actionable intelligence.


In summary, COMPASS is SILO’s insight engine for discovery, designed to drive user engagement and confidence. It aligns with SILO’s mission of bringing clarity and personalization to supplementation by cutting through noise and highlighting evidence-backed trends. For investors, COMPASS represents a compelling value proposition: it increases platform stickiness and cross-selling of SILO’s other features by continuously surfacing relevant content. For engineers, it presents a modern, scalable architecture (built on Supabase, Postgres, Redis caching, and an ML-powered search stack) that showcases how multiple data sources and microservices can be orchestrated to deliver a seamless, intelligent user experience.

2. Product Vision & Value Proposition
Vision: 
The vision of COMPASS is to become the go-to discovery hub for supplement intelligence – a place where every individual can confidently find out what supplements or protocols might benefit them (or their clients/patients) by learning from both cutting-edge research and the collective experiences of the SILO community. COMPASS aims to replace guesswork and social-media-driven fads with rigorous, real-time insight, ensuring that trending supplements and health regimens are highlighted because they are effective and backed by data, not due to marketing hype. In the SILO platform’s future, COMPASS will evolve into a personalized trend advisor: as soon as a relevant new study is published or a supplement gains traction among similar users, COMPASS will intelligently surface that information to those who would benefit from it. This aligns with SILO’s broader vision of a world where supplement routines are built on evidence and shared knowledge rather than hearsay. Whether someone is a biohacker exploring the latest nootropic or a physician monitoring supplement use trends in patient populations, COMPASS aspires to be the trusted compass guiding them through the supplement landscape.
Value Proposition: 
COMPASS delivers significant value by fusing community-driven trends with scientific evidence into one discovery interface. It addresses key pain points:
Clarity in a Noisy Market: Today’s supplement market is flooded with conflicting information and overwhelming choices. COMPASS distills this chaos by spotlighting only those supplements and protocols that are rising to prominence for good reason, each accompanied by context like quality of research and user outcomes. Users gain clear insight into which supplements are genuinely effective or popular and why, cutting through anecdotal hype.
Evidence-Backed Trends: Unlike generic “trending products” lists on e-commerce sites, COMPASS cross-references trends with scientific literature. Every trending supplement card is enriched with a mini research summary and quality score from SILO’s LENS database, ensuring that popularity is viewed alongside evidence. This provides a unique evidence-based confidence to users: a supplement trending on COMPASS isn’t just popular – it’s likely supported by credible data (and if not, that lack of strong evidence is transparently indicated).
Personalized Discovery: As the user base grows, COMPASS will tailor trend insights to individual profiles. For example, a user interested in “immunity” might see trending protocols relevant to immune health first. Over time, with machine learning, COMPASS could even predict and highlight emerging supplements that fit a user’s specific goals or demographic, effectively becoming a forward-looking recommendation engine.
Community Intelligence without Compromise: COMPASS harnesses collective intelligence (e.g. “most copied stack this week” or “supplement X is used by 30% of users with goal Y”) in a way that maintains privacy and trust. All community-sourced data is anonymized and aggregated. The value to users is that they can learn from others (“crowd wisdom”) to validate their choices or discover new ideas, while being assured that their own data remains private. This transparent-yet-private approach bolsters trust – a key value proposition of SILO (no exploitation of personal data for social features or ads).
Integrated Platform Synergy: As part of SILO’s vertically integrated platform, COMPASS amplifies the value of the other pillars. It drives users from curiosity to action: an interesting article or trend spotted in COMPASS can be immediately acted on through VANTA Lab (by adding a supplement to one’s regimen) or further researched via LENS. This seamless flow from discovery to personalization is a compelling differentiator. Competitors might offer isolated features (like a research database or a forum with popular discussions), but COMPASS’s value lies in unifying these within a single ecosystem tied directly to user’s personal health management.


In essence, COMPASS’s value proposition is to empower users with intelligent discovery: it guides them to better decisions by highlighting what’s trending and why, ultimately helping them optimize their health routines with confidence. This strengthens SILO’s overall value: users are more likely to engage deeply and stay on the platform when they continuously find relevant, credible insights that they cannot get elsewhere. For investors, this means higher user retention and opportunities for monetization (e.g., premium insights or partnerships with brands for trending products), while for the end-user it means always having a finger on the pulse of the supplement world with minimal effort.

3. Primary & Secondary Personas


Understanding the target personas is crucial for tailoring COMPASS’s features and tone. The primary persona represents the core user base, while secondary personas represent additional stakeholders whose needs are considered in the design. Below, we outline these personas and how COMPASS serves each:


Primary Persona: Health-Conscious Consumer (Everyday User)
This is the individual supplement user – ranging from wellness enthusiasts and biohackers to everyday individuals striving to improve their health. They may not be experts, but they are proactive and curious. Their needs include: discovering new supplements or stacks for their goals (e.g., “What’s new for improving sleep?”), validating supplements they’ve heard about (checking if a trending ingredient is actually effective), and staying updated on general supplement trends. COMPASS provides them an easy way to explore what others are doing and which supplements are popular or effective, without wading through dubious forums or ads. For example, a consumer can search for a supplement like “Ashwagandha” and immediately see a rich card showing how widely it’s used, what benefits people seek from it, associated research, typical pricing, and any warnings, then decide to add it to their regimen if appropriate. This persona values simplicity and credibility – they want clear guidance and assurance that it’s grounded in evidence. COMPASS’s intuitive search and card interface addresses this, letting them go from curiosity to informed decision in minutes.


Secondary Persona: Clinician or Health Practitioner
This user is a health professional (e.g., a functional medicine doctor, nutritionist, or pharmacist) who uses SILO as a professional tool to stay informed and to support patient recommendations. Their focus is on evidence and patient safety, but they are also interested in what patients are taking on their own. COMPASS serves clinicians by highlighting trends in supplement usage that might inform clinical discussions – for instance, if many users are combining Vitamin D with K2, a clinician might note that as a common synergy and ensure their patients do the same safely. They can quickly look up a supplement in COMPASS during a consultation to see an “at-a-glance” dossier (including efficacy evidence from studies, dosage ranges, and any common user-reported effects or interactions). The value for this persona is saving time – instead of combing research literature and anecdotal reports separately, COMPASS aggregates both in one view. Additionally, privacy-preserving community stats can clue clinicians into emerging popular therapies (e.g., “X% of users dealing with stress have started taking L-theanine”). While clinicians will ultimately rely on their medical judgment, COMPASS gives them a credible snapshot of the supplement landscape to enhance patient consultations.


Secondary Persona: Supplement Brand Manager / Industry Analyst
This persona represents supplement company stakeholders (product managers, marketers) or industry analysts. They are not typical end-users of SILO’s consumer features, but COMPASS insights are highly valuable to them. They want to know market trends: which ingredients are gaining popularity, which stacks consumers are gravitating towards, and how their brand’s products fare in terms of popularity or user ratings. COMPASS’s anonymized trend data and leaderboards become a form of market intelligence. For example, a brand manager might see that “Collagen peptides” are in the top 3 most logged supplements this quarter, prompting them to consider developing a collagen product or adjusting marketing. The interactive supplement card can also reveal how users perceive quality (via brand scorecards in AEGIS) – if their brand consistently ranks below a competitor in user adoption or quality flags, that’s actionable insight. For this persona, user privacy remains paramount – they only see aggregate data, not personal details – but even aggregated trends (the “collective intelligence”) help them make strategic decisions. While SILO is primarily consumer-facing, acknowledging this persona can lead to future opportunities (such as professional dashboards or data partnerships), some of which are considered in the roadmap.


Secondary Persona: Researcher & Content Curator
This encompasses academic researchers, supplement scientists, or even editorial staff who might use COMPASS to identify interesting patterns and knowledge gaps. A nutrition science researcher, for example, could use COMPASS to discover which supplements are widely used for certain health goals despite limited research – highlighting areas that merit further study. They might search by a condition or biomarker and see which supplements the community is gravitating toward for that issue, then dive into the LENS research summaries to gauge the state of evidence. Conversely, they might use COMPASS to gauge public interest in a supplement they are studying (“Is the usage of NAD+ trending upward this year?”). For editorial roles (perhaps those writing featured articles on SILO), COMPASS provides direct insight into what’s trending, ensuring that spotlight content is timely and relevant to user interests. The value for researchers is the ability to correlate real-world usage data with scientific literature quickly. By seeing community trends, they get hypotheses or validation points for research (e.g., if many people report taking a particular herb for anxiety, it might justify a clinical trial or at least a literature review). For content creators, COMPASS data ensures articles are hitting topics that users care about. This persona benefits from COMPASS’s data richness and searchability – they can trust that the trends are based on robust data, and they can easily pull up supporting evidence or statistics for their work.

4. Core Feature Matrix


COMPASS comprises a set of features that together create a comprehensive discovery and trend intelligence experience. The table below outlines each primary feature and its purpose:
Searchable Supplement & Protocol Database: A fast, intelligent search system that allows users to query thousands of supplements and pre-built protocols. This search isn’t a simple text lookup – it supports common names, aliases, and even goal-oriented queries thanks to semantic search (e.g., a user can type “muscle recovery” and see relevant supplements/protocols, not just exact name matches). Results are organized by category (e.g. Supplements, Protocols, Articles) for clarity. This feature addresses the user’s need to quickly find information on a specific supplement or regimen. It is must-have foundational functionality: essentially the gateway to COMPASS’s intelligence. For example, if a user searches “creatine”, the system retrieves the canonical supplement entry from the Supplement DB, any matching community protocols involving creatine, and relevant articles, all in one go. The intelligent search ensures that even if a user misspells a name or uses a colloquial term, they still get relevant hits (via typo-tolerant and synonym matching, powered by Postgres trigram indices and vector embeddings).
Interactive Supplement Card Interface: A rich, interactive slide-in panel that presents a 360° view of a selected supplement (or potentially a protocol) in an easy-to-read “card” format. When a user clicks on a search result or a trending item, the supplement card is generated in real-time by aggregating data from multiple SILO databases and engines. Each card typically includes:
Overview & Research Score: A brief summary of what the supplement is and a “research credibility” score or tier (indicating the strength of evidence from LENS – e.g., strong evidence, mixed evidence, etc.).
User Metrics: Real-time anonymized stats such as what percentage of SILO users have this supplement in their stack, or how usage has trended over time. It might say, for example, “32% of users log Creatine”, giving immediate context to its popularity.
Common Stacks & Synergies: A highlight of frequently associated supplements or common stack pairings (derived from Stack DB analytics). For instance, a card for Vitamin D might note “Often paired with: Magnesium, Vitamin K2,” indicating a synergy or common protocol combination. This helps users discover complementary supplements.
Brand Audit Insights: Pulled from AEGIS/Brand DB, the card can showcase top-rated brands or products for this supplement and any quality notes. For example, “Best-quality brands: Brand A, Brand B (third-party tested); no known purity issues.” It may also show an average price range (“Typical monthly cost: $15–$20”), and a quick link to view more brand details if needed.
Literature Backdrop: A concise research summary generated by the RAG Engine – e.g., “Summary of findings: Clinical studies suggest creatine improves muscle power (Level A evidence) and may aid cognitive function.” This is typically a 2-3 sentence layman summary with an option to dig deeper (link to full LENS entries or citations). The system might highlight the highest-quality study supporting the supplement’s primary benefit.
Warnings & Contraindications: Any red-flag information, such as known drug interactions, side effects, or regulatory warnings. This is powered by data like FDA advisories and the NLP Engine’s extraction of contraindications. For example, “Contraindication: Not advised for individuals with kidney disease” might appear in a creatine card if applicable. Also, if a supplement has had recent recall or legal status change, that would be noted (with data potentially from regulatory feeds).
Add-to-Stack Functionality: A prominent button to “Add to VANTA Lab”. If the user wants to include this supplement in their personal regimen, one click will initiate that process (seamlessly sending the supplement info to the VANTA Lab stack builder). This tight integration shortens the journey from discovery to action – users don’t have to manually re-enter details. After adding, the card/UI can even indicate that “This supplement is now in your stack” (possibly showing personal adherence stats or allowing quick logging from the card, if relevant).
Additional Details: As needed, the card can show basic “bio” info about the supplement – e.g., chemical classification, forms (like “Magnesium Glycinate, Chelate forms available”), solubility/bioavailability notes, typical dosage range for adults, etc. Some of these details come from the Supplement DB (which stores default dosing ranges and bioavailability flags). These help users understand practical usage aspects at a glance.
The supplement card interface is central to COMPASS’s UX – it provides a single authoritative view built from multiple sources, which is far more convenient than the user piecing together info from separate pages or external sites. It’s interactive and updated in real-time (with caching to ensure performance) so that even dynamic metrics reflect the latest state every time a user opens the card.
Real-Time Anonymized Usage Stats: COMPASS continuously surfaces real-time statistics about how the SILO community is using supplements and protocols, all in an aggregated and privacy-preserving manner. This feature includes dynamic metrics like:
“Most Logged Supplements This Week” – e.g., a live counter or list (Creatine used by 120 users, Omega-3 by 115 users, etc.).
“Most Copied Stack Templates” – highlighting which of the curated protocol templates (or user-created stacks) have been imported or duplicated the most in recent period.
“Rising Star” supplement – an ingredient that saw a significant uptick in usage or searches in the last month.
Community benchmark stats within user context – e.g., when viewing their dashboard or a supplement card, a user might see “Your regimen has 8 items, which is more than 70% of users” or “67% of users with similar goals also include Ashwagandha”. (Such benchmarks overlap with features of the Analytics Engine and dashboard, but COMPASS is where they are showcased broadly.)
These stats are valuable because they tap into the wisdom of the crowd. Users often want to know “What are others taking?” and “Am I missing something popular for my goal?”. By providing these answers, COMPASS keeps users engaged and informed. All stats are updated on a defined schedule (some may be real-time, others daily aggregated) and are carefully anonymized – no personal identifiers, just counts and percentages. This feature reinforces transparency: users see that the platform truly uses community data to generate insights while respecting privacy.
Leaderboards & Trending Protocols: Expanding on usage stats, COMPASS offers interactive leaderboards – essentially lists or rankings – for various categories:
Top Supplements (overall, or filtered by category/goal): e.g., “Top 10 Supplements for Stress (this month)” or simply overall “Top 10 most tracked supplements”. This helps users quickly identify what the community finds most useful or interesting at a given time.
Trending Protocols/Stacks: Showcasing complete protocols that are popular. For instance, a “Sleep Optimization Stack” might be trending if many users adopted it or if its components see high adherence. Leaderboards might show a stack name, its primary goal, and a couple of key supplements in it, plus maybe an “adoption count” or growth rate.
Top New Entries: If new supplements or experimental compounds are added to the database or started being tracked by users, this can highlight them (e.g., a new herbal extract just got introduced and 20 users immediately started logging it).
Brand Leaderboard (optional/future): Possibly a ranking of supplement brands by user trust or adoption – though this overlaps with AEGIS, COMPASS could highlight “Top 5 most used brands on SILO” as a form of trend intelligence for users curious about quality and popularity.
The leaderboards are presented in a way that invites exploration – each item might be clickable to view the detailed supplement or stack card. For example, if “Immunity Boost Protocol” is #1 this week, clicking it would show the protocol’s contents and performance. These trending lists refresh regularly (e.g., daily or weekly) and can be filtered by time range. The value to users is a quick pulse-check on the community: What’s everyone doing right now? For new users, it’s an onboarding aid (they can start by trying popular stacks). For experienced users, it’s a way to discover new ideas or validate that they’re on the cutting edge.
Featured Articles & Editorial Spotlights: To complement the raw data and stats, COMPASS includes a content section managed via an internal CMS that delivers human-curated insights:
Featured Articles: In-depth pieces written by SILO’s experts or contributors that discuss trending topics. For example, an article like “Stack Spotlight: Top 5 Emerging Nootropics in 2025” might appear, providing narrative context and advice around those supplements (with references). These articles leverage COMPASS data (e.g., they might be chosen because those nootropics showed up in trending stats) and the LENS research database to ensure accuracy.
Editorial Spotlights: Short-form highlights or commentary on new developments. For instance, if a major study was published about vitamin D, an editorial note in COMPASS might summarize it and highlight that supplement in the trending section. Or if a particular user-created protocol (anonymously shared) is gaining popularity, a spotlight could interview the (willing) creator or dissect why it’s trending (again, without revealing identities unless it’s an opt-in community feature).
News & Updates: Integration of external news feeds (future possibility), like alerts on regulatory changes or safety warnings, formatted as brief posts in the COMPASS feed.
The presence of editorial content ensures that not everything in COMPASS is automated data – it adds a storytelling and educational element. This is important for investor-grade polish (showing thought leadership) and for user engagement, as it provides context and expert interpretation of trends. These articles can also drive traffic and SEO if portions of COMPASS are publicly visible. Each piece would be linked to relevant supplements or protocols (e.g., an article about “Supplements for Post-COVID Recovery” would link to each supplement’s card and perhaps offer to import a recommended protocol to VANTA Lab). The content platform is likely powered by a lightweight CMS or even a section of the database that stores articles, and it is designed to be easily updated by the SILO team (non-engineers) on a regular schedule.
Community Behavior Browsing Interface: Without exposing any personal data, COMPASS provides an interface to browse community-driven content. This includes:
Public Protocol Library: A library of protocols that have been shared or published (with user consent). For example, if a researcher or an advanced user creates a novel stack and chooses to share it with the community, it can appear (anonymously or attributed if they choose) in a browsable gallery. Other users can then copy or adapt these community protocols. Early on, this might just be curated expert templates, but over time it could expand.
Filters and Tags: Users can filter trending content by categories or tags (e.g., see what’s trending in “Sleep”, “Fitness”, “Cognitive Enhancement”). This makes discovery more relevant to individual interests.
Safe Social Proof: Possibly displays of aggregated user feedback – for instance, a protocol might show “High adherence: 80% of users stick with this for 8+ weeks” or a supplement might show an average satisfaction rating if such feedback is collected. However, COMPASS deliberately avoids any direct social features (no visible user profiles or direct interactions by default) to remain privacy-first. The design shows community behavior in numbers and trends, not personal posts.
In summary, this interface allows a user to explore the ecosystem in a guided way, almost like browsing a “store” of knowledge and routines. It’s analogous to how one might browse trending topics on a forum, but with all content aggregated and depersonalized by design. The user gets the benefit of community experience (“what’s everyone doing or finding useful?”) with none of the downsides of a social network (no noise, no privacy issues, no need to actively participate). This feature ensures COMPASS is not just a search tool but also a discovery feed, encouraging frequent engagement (users might check COMPASS regularly to see “what’s new or hot this week”).


Each of these core features works in concert to fulfill COMPASS’s role as the discovery and trend intelligence layer of SILO. The searchable database and supplement cards provide the mechanism to get detailed info on demand, the usage stats and leaderboards provide the signals about what matters now, and the editorial content and community browsing add human context and discoverability. Together, they deliver a robust feature set that caters to the needs of our personas: consumers get guidance and new ideas, clinicians get quick evidence and trend overviews, brands glean market intel, and researchers see real-world patterns – all through one integrated platform.

5. End-to-End User Journeys


Journey 1: Consumer – Discovering and Adopting a Trending Supplement
Persona: A 30-year-old fitness enthusiast (primary consumer) named Alex, who wants to improve muscle recovery and has heard about “some new supplement everyone at the gym is talking about.”
Entry Point: Alex logs into SILO and lands on the Dashboard. He notices on the Dashboard or COMPASS widget that “Creatine Monohydrate” is listed as one of the top trending supplements this month (perhaps 2nd on the “Top Supplements” leaderboard) due to a surge in community usage. Intrigued (and recalling gym chatter about creatine), Alex clicks it.
Discovery in COMPASS: COMPASS opens the supplement card for Creatine. At a glance, Alex sees a summary: “Creatine – Performance & Muscle Recovery Supplement. Used by 32% of users, strong evidence for strength gains.” There’s a quick bullet: “Research Score: A (Multiple RCTs show efficacy for power output)”. He also sees “Common Stacks: often combined with Whey Protein, Magnesium” – one of which he’s already taking, the other he isn’t. The card shows a price band (e.g., “$10-$15/month”) and notes that “Best-quality brands: Optimum Nutrition, X Brand (Lab-verified)”. It also flags “Contraindication: ensure adequate hydration; not recommended if you have kidney issues” (which doesn’t apply to him, but good to know).
Decision & Action: Convinced by the data (popularity and solid research backing) and happy to see no red flags for him, Alex decides to add Creatine to his regimen. He clicks “Add to Stack” on the Creatine card. This brings up a prompt to choose which stack (he has a personal “Workout stack”), and with confirmation, the supplement is added to his VANTA Lab stack instantly. The system even asks if he wants to use the default dosage (5g daily) as per the card’s info. Alex agrees.
Feedback & Integration: On adding, the COMPASS card now indicates “In Your Stack” with maybe a small icon or his current adherence (if he had any history with it, which he didn’t). The integration means VANTA Lab now includes Creatine for Alex, and he can set reminders or see it in his routine immediately. Also, because the platform updates analytics in real-time, Alex’s action increments the usage count of Creatine (anonymously) in the global stats.
Further Exploration: Alex scrolls down in COMPASS and sees a Featured Article: “The 5 Supplements Most Copied in SILO – and Why.” Creatine is listed as #1 in that article with more background (which aligns with what he saw on the card). He reads a bit of it to reinforce his decision (the article explains how to take creatine properly and debunks a myth, for example). Feeling informed, Alex closes COMPASS. Over the next weeks, he logs his supplement intake via the app; as he does so, the Dashboard and potentially COMPASS’s personalized stats might start showing him how his adherence or improvements compare to others. For instance, after a month, he might see a benchmark: “Your strength increased 5% (self-reported) – users on creatine with similar profiles see a 7% increase on average”, which is a deeper future possibility via the Analytics Engine and COMPASS’s benchmarking features.
Outcome: Alex’s journey shows how COMPASS effectively took him from a question (“what’s this popular supplement?”) to a decision backed by data, to seamlessly updating his regimen. The key is that at each step, the system provided useful info: trending context drew him in, the card gave evidence and practical info, and adding to stack was frictionless. Alex is more engaged with SILO as a result – he trusts the platform not just to track what he already knew, but to learn new insights. He’s likely to return to COMPASS periodically, e.g., when he considers another goal (maybe improving sleep next).


Journey 2: Clinician – Researching a Protocol & Advising a Patient
Persona: Dr. Maria, an integrative medicine physician (secondary persona) who has an upcoming appointment with a patient interested in managing anxiety through supplements.
Trigger: The patient mentioned they started a regimen they found online involving ashwagandha, L-theanine, and magnesium for anxiety. Dr. Maria is familiar with these individually but wants to quickly see if there are known effective combinations or what the broader community experience is.
Using COMPASS: Dr. Maria logs into her SILO professional account (in future, perhaps a specialized view, but currently maybe the same interface). She goes to COMPASS and uses the search bar to type “Anxiety protocol”. The search’s semantic capability returns results under Protocols (perhaps some curated templates for stress/anxiety) and Supplements (ashwagandha is a top hit, L-theanine as well). She clicks on a Protocol result named “Calm Mind Stack (Community Template)”.
Protocol Exploration: A protocol card or page appears (similar to a supplement card but for a stack) showing the components: Ashwagandha, L-Theanine, Magnesium, and Rhodiola. It indicates it’s a community-shared protocol with a goal tag “Anxiety/Stress relief”. COMPASS shows community metrics like “Adopted by 54 users” and “Average adherence: 75% over 3 months (above average)” – suggesting people are generally sticking with it. It also shows “Most common modification: adding Vitamin B6” (perhaps surfaced by comparing variations in user-copied versions). These insights give Dr. Maria a quick real-world validation that many people try this and often sustain it.
Evidence Check: Dr. Maria then clicks on Ashwagandha from within that protocol card to see its supplement card. Here she pays attention to the Literature Backdrop: it summarizes that “Ashwagandha has strong evidence for stress reduction (multiple trials showing reduced cortisol); common dose 300-500mg.” It also notes “Quality: look for KSM-66 or Sensoril extracts (high concentration)” and perhaps “No major adverse effects reported in studies, mild drowsiness possible.” She appreciates that citations are accessible (COMPASS could allow her to click a reference ID to view the study in LENS if she wants the detailed paper). She might also glance at L-Theanine’s card, which shows “Evidence: good support for acute anxiety reduction, especially in combination with caffeine modulation.” This cross-checking takes her maybe 5 minutes, far less than searching multiple journals.
Privacy-Preserving Curiosity: Out of curiosity, Dr. Maria wonders how prevalent supplement use for anxiety is among SILO users. She uses a filter or looks at a COMPASS stat: perhaps under a “Conditions” filter, Anxiety is listed and shows “120 active users are following an anxiety support protocol.” This is all anonymous, but it gives her a sense of how common this self-directed approach is. If the number were extremely low or high it might influence her perspective on how mainstream it is among health-conscious users.
Clinical Decision: Armed with this info, in the appointment Dr. Maria can confidently discuss the patient’s stack: she can affirm that ashwagandha and L-theanine have evidence and a good track record (pointing out, if needed, that many people on the SILO platform use them effectively). She might caution about Rhodiola (if COMPASS indicated possible stimulant effects or if research is less robust). Perhaps she even finds via COMPASS that adding Magnesium is common and advisable for anxiety, which aligns with her own knowledge. Ultimately, she either validates the patient’s plan or refines it (maybe recommending a specific high-quality brand for Ashwagandha that she saw on the card). She documents the plan, feeling reassured that her advice is backed by both clinical evidence and up-to-date usage trends.
Outcome: COMPASS served as a rapid research and validation tool in the clinical workflow. The journey highlights how quick access to aggregated knowledge (community + research) can enhance professional decision-making. It saves the clinician time and provides unique insights (like adherence rates to a given protocol) that traditional sources don’t have. Over time, if SILO introduces a dedicated clinician dashboard, such data could be integrated more directly, but even in the base product, COMPASS proves valuable for professional users.


Journey 3: Brand Manager – Monitoring Trends for Market Insight
Persona: James, a product manager at a supplement company (secondary persona, brand stakeholder) who has access to SILO’s COMPASS via a business subscription or simply uses the public-facing trends.
Objective: James wants to keep an eye on emerging supplement trends to inform their product development roadmap. His company specializes in nootropics and adaptogens.
Using COMPASS (Business Context): James navigates to COMPASS’s leaderboards section. He filters the trending supplements to “Cognitive” category to see what brain-health related substances are hot. He sees “Lion’s Mane Mushroom” and “Bacopa Monnieri” in the top 5 trending cognitive supplements. Bacopa, interestingly, has jumped from rank 10 to rank 4 in the last quarter (perhaps COMPASS indicates a ▲ upward trend icon). This catches his attention – Bacopa hasn’t been heavily marketed lately, so the trend likely comes from genuine consumer interest or new research.
Drilling Down: He clicks Bacopa’s entry to get more details. The supplement card tells him: usage up by 20% in 3 months, about 15% of SILO users who have a cognitive focus goal include Bacopa. It also shows a research blurb (e.g., “Emerging evidence for memory enhancement, though mixed results”) and that top brands for Bacopa (according to AEGIS) include a competitor’s product. He notes that their own brand isn’t in the top list – a sign they might be missing out or need better quality.
Competitive Insight: Switching to a Brand leaderboard (if available), James looks at “Top Brands used by SILO users”. Suppose SILO surfaces a list of most commonly logged product brands and their average user rating (if user ratings exist, or simply usage count). He sees that for nootropics, three competitor brands consistently rank above his. Additionally, COMPASS’s community stats might reveal “X% of users prefer brands that are third-party tested for heavy metals” – aligning with SILO’s quality emphasis. This signals to James the importance of emphasizing or improving their testing protocols to meet user expectations reflected in SILO data.
Outcome & Actions: James compiles these insights: Bacopa trending upward (so maybe they should formulate a Bacopa product or feature it in marketing), and competitive quality signals (improve their product or communicate quality better). If SILO offers a formal report or API for business users in the future, he might export the trending data. Even without that, the publicly visible trends give valuable directional info. This journey demonstrates how COMPASS’s trend intelligence can extend beyond individual users to industry stakeholders, adding another dimension to SILO’s impact (and potential revenue via B2B data services or partnerships) while still prioritizing user privacy (James sees only aggregated data, no personal info).






Journey 4: Researcher – Identifying Gaps and Staying Current
Persona: Dr. Lee, a nutrition science researcher (secondary persona) focusing on supplements for metabolic health, who uses SILO to gather real-world insight for hypothesis generation.
Objective: Dr. Lee wants to know what supplements people interested in “metabolic health” are actually using. This can help him identify which popular supplements lack robust research (a potential gap his next study could fill) or confirm patterns he’s seeing in literature.
Using COMPASS: He goes to COMPASS and uses the search filters: selects the tag or goal “Metabolic / Blood Sugar”. COMPASS shows him a trending protocols list filtered for that goal. The top protocol is “Blood Sugar Support Stack”, including things like Berberine, Cinnamon, Magnesium, and Chromium. It also shows that, say, 80 users follow some variant of this. Next, the “Top Supplements for Metabolic Health” list highlights: #1 Berberine, #2 Omega-3, #3 Cinnamon, #4 Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV). ACV catches his eye – it’s #4 by popularity, yet he knows from literature that the evidence for ACV’s effect on blood sugar is modest.
Deep Dive: He clicks Apple Cider Vinegar to see details. The card shows “Used by 10% of metabolic-focused users”, and the research summary might note “Mixed evidence: some small studies show improved insulin sensitivity, others no effect. Mostly anecdotal support.” This disparity between moderate popularity and mixed evidence intrigues Dr. Lee – it suggests many people are trying ACV for lack of better options or due to hype. This could indicate a research gap or an education gap.
Comparative Insight: Dr. Lee compares ACV’s card to Berberine’s card (the #1 supplement). Berberine’s summary likely shows “Strong evidence for blood sugar lowering (similar efficacy to metformin in some trials)”, which justifies its top rank. The usage stat might be even higher. The contrast is useful: one is popular and evidence-backed, the other is popular despite weaker evidence. As a researcher, this helps him prioritize: perhaps focus on studying ACV more rigorously or developing better education around it, etc.
Staying Current: Dr. Lee also checks COMPASS’s Featured Articles, where he finds an editorial piece “Trending in Research: New Findings on Metabolic Supplements.” This editorial (potentially automatically partially generated via LENS updates) summarizes any recent high-profile studies – e.g., “A new RCT on Cinnamon showed X result” – which keeps him up-to-date without scanning journals constantly. Since SILO’s LENS likely ingests and scores new research, COMPASS can highlight these in a user-friendly way.
Outcome: Dr. Lee leaves COMPASS with a clearer picture of the current supplement landscape for metabolic health. He might even decide to use the data in a grant proposal: “SILO platform data indicates thousands of individuals use ACV for blood sugar control, yet evidence is inconclusive – our proposed study will rigorously assess ACV’s efficacy…”. By integrating COMPASS into his workflow, he ensures his research questions are grounded in real user behavior and needs. His journey underscores how COMPASS can influence and inspire scientific research, closing the loop between real-world usage and academic inquiry.


These user journeys demonstrate end-to-end flows for various personas, highlighting how COMPASS supports discovery, decision-making, and action:
For consumers, it’s an intuitive exploration and quick action to improve their regimen.
For clinicians, it’s a rapid evidence check and trend awareness to complement their expertise.
For brand stakeholders, it’s passive intelligence gathering for strategic decisions.
For researchers, it’s a pulse on the public’s interests and a shortcut to relevant evidence.


In all cases, COMPASS provides value at each step while integrating smoothly with SILO’s other components (like VANTA Lab for regimen changes or LENS for detailed research access). The design of these journeys also informed certain features – for instance, the need for quick add-to-stack came from observing consumer behavior, and the need for filtering by goal/tags came from personas like clinicians and researchers wanting targeted info. Ensuring these journeys are smooth and satisfying is key to COMPASS’s success in driving engagement and outcomes.


6. UX & Interaction Patterns (Desktop & Mobile)


COMPASS is designed with a user-centric UX that makes complex data feel accessible and engaging. Below are the key interaction patterns and UI elements, along with notes on responsive (desktop vs mobile) behavior:
Global Search Bar (“Compass Spotlight”): At the top of the COMPASS interface (and often accessible globally via a nav bar search icon) is a smart search bar.
Type-ahead Suggestions: As soon as the user begins typing, a dropdown of suggestions appears, updating in real-time but with a slight debounce to avoid overwhelming the server. Suggestions are categorized into Supplements, Protocols, and Articles/Content for clarity. For example, typing “creat” might show “Creatine (Supplement)”, “Creatine for muscle gain (Article)”, “Creatine + Beta-Alanine Stack (Protocol)” in different groupings. This helps users visually parse the results and encourages exploration of different content types.
The type-ahead is especially important on mobile, where screen space is limited – it allows users to quickly select what they need without typing full queries. On mobile, the suggestions might occupy the whole screen as a overlay list for easier tapping.
The styling is clean and highlights matching terms (e.g., bolded substrings), with perhaps small icons or tags to denote type (pill icon for supplement, stack icon for protocol, document icon for article).
Navigation & Layout: On desktop, COMPASS might appear as a dedicated section of the SILO web app, accessible via the main menu (e.g., a “Compass” tab next to Dashboard, VANTA Lab, etc.). The layout often uses a two-column or three-column design:
Left sidebar (or top nav on mobile): for filtering and navigation within COMPASS. This could include filters by category (e.g., Goals, Supplement Categories, Recent vs All-time trends) and links to sub-sections (like “Trending Now”, “Protocols”, “Articles”, etc.). On mobile, this might be a collapsible menu or a horizontal scroll of pill-shaped filter buttons.
Main content area: which shows either the search results or the default discovery feed. The default feed (when no search query is active) is crucial: it might show a “Today’s Highlights” section (featured article or featured stack of the day) on top, followed by Trending lists (as cards or simple lists), and possibly a prompt like “What are you looking for?” to encourage search. It should not overwhelm, but provide an interesting snapshot (like a magazine front page for supplement trends).
Supplement/Protocol Card overlay: When a user selects a result (either from search suggestions or by clicking an item in trending lists), the supplement card appears. On desktop, this might slide in from the right as a panel overlay (dimming the background, but not fully redirecting away, allowing easy closing). It might consume 30-40% of width or even more, like a drawer. On mobile, this likely becomes a full-screen page or modal that overlays since screen is small.
The card has a consistent layout: top section for name and any quick tags or score, body with sections for metrics, research, etc., possibly separated by subtle subheadings or tabs if needed (though scrolling is fine if content is well-ordered).
Importantly, whether on desktop or mobile, the user should easily navigate back: a clear “X” or back button to close the card (returning to whatever they were doing, e.g., search results or trending page), and if they came via search, they can refine the query further.
Desktop Interactions: With more screen space, desktop can show more context simultaneously. For example:
A user could have the trending list on the left and when they click an item, the card opens on the right. This side-by-side allows browsing multiple items quickly (like scanning down a list and seeing details without full page loads each time).
Hover behaviors may be used: e.g., hovering over a supplement name might show a tiny tooltip with one key stat (though generally clicking to open the card is the main interaction).
Rich interactive charts might be included on desktop: for instance, a small sparkline of usage over time or a bar chart for “Top 5 in category” could be embedded in the trending section for visual flair. Desktop can handle these next to text.
The interface likely uses responsive tables or cards for leaderboards – on desktop a table with columns (Rank, Name, Growth %, etc.) could be shown, whereas on mobile this might collapse into a swipeable card list.
Mobile Interactions: On mobile devices (likely via responsive web, since native apps are a roadmap item beyond initial release), the emphasis is on simplicity and easy tapping:
The search bar might be prominent on the top of the mobile screen when COMPASS is active, perhaps with a larger touch-friendly input.
Filter menus might become dropdowns or bottom sheets. For example, tapping a “Filter” button could slide up a panel where the user can select categories or date range.
The trending lists that appear on desktop’s main content area might become carousel sliders or vertically stacked cards on mobile. For instance, a horizontal scroll of “Top Supplements” with each item as a card (showing rank, name, maybe an icon of the supplement or pie chart icon representing usage). The user can swipe through them.
The supplement card on mobile will likely use a tabbed interface or an accordion for sections if it’s long. E.g., one tab for “Overview”, one for “Research & Data”, one for “User Stats”. Or simply a long scroll with clear section headers and maybe a floating “Add to Stack” button at the bottom for quick action. The design must ensure that the key call-to-action (add to stack) and vital warnings aren’t lost at the very bottom on a small screen.
Because there’s no hover, everything is tap-activated. So if on desktop additional details might appear on hover charts, on mobile they might appear on tap or not at all. We lean towards a design that doesn’t hide necessary info behind hover-only interactions so that mobile is first-class.
Consistency: Both on desktop and mobile, COMPASS follows SILO’s overall design language – likely modern, clean typography, a calming color scheme (since health-related, perhaps blues/greens), and clear iconography. Each supplement might have an icon or illustration (not necessary but could help identify at a glance). The use of icons (like a flame icon for “trending”, an up-arrow for “rising”, shield for “safety warning”, book for “research”) can convey meaning quickly and is consistent across devices.
Performance & Feedback: The UI is built to feel snappy:
As mentioned, suggestions load quickly due to debouncing and likely caching of common queries. If a query was done recently (or a card was opened by any user recently), the Edge cache or Redis might already have the card ready, making the card open near-instantly.
Loading indicators: When the user searches or opens a card, there’s a brief loading spinner or shimmer on the card area to indicate something is happening. Because the architecture caches results for 30 minutes by slug, oft-viewed items appear almost immediately on subsequent views.
If any part of the card is still loading (say the RAG summary from the NLP service is a tad slower), the UI uses placeholder text and then gracefully fills it in so the user can start reading other parts. This ensures a fluid feel rather than making the user wait staring at a blank card.
On actions like “Add to Stack”, immediate feedback is given – e.g., the button might turn into a checkmark or say “Added” and perhaps prompt “View in VANTA Lab?” if they want to jump. Error states (like if offline or network issue) are handled with clear messages.
Integration points in UX:
COMPASS doesn’t exist in isolation; the design includes subtle links to other pillars. For example, on a supplement card, the “Research summary” might have a button “View more in LENS” that takes the user to the LENS section with a pre-filled search for that supplement’s studies. Similarly, brand info might have a link “View full brand profile in AEGIS”. These open either in new tabs or within the app’s routing to those sections, maintaining context.
The Dashboard might preview COMPASS content to entice users in. For instance, the user’s home dashboard could show a widget: “Community Trend: Omega-3 usage is up 15% – find out why” which when clicked goes to a COMPASS article or card about Omega-3. This cross-linking ensures users discover COMPASS features organically.
Accessibility & Responsive Design: The interface uses responsive web design to accommodate a range of devices and also considers accessibility:
Font sizes and contrast are chosen to be readable (especially important for potentially older users or clinicians).
Keyboard navigation on desktop is supported (e.g., arrow through search suggestions, press Enter to open, etc.).
For screen readers, each section and data point has appropriate labels (e.g., the stats have hidden labels like “Percentage of users who take this supplement” so it’s not just “32%” read out of context).
Touch targets on mobile are designed with sufficient size and spacing.
UX Flow Example (Desktop): A typical flow might be: User clicks COMPASS tab -> sees a homepage with “Featured Today” (perhaps an image and title for an article or a highlighted stack), below that two columns: left “Trending Supplements” (list 1-10), right “Trending Protocols”. They click a supplement from left -> a right sidebar overlay opens with the supplement card, covering the trending lists partially. They read, scroll, click “Add to Stack”. A toast confirms addition. They close the card (or click outside it) -> the trending list is still there for them to pick another. Finally, they might click the featured article which takes them to a full-page article view (with rich text, images, etc.), and from within that article, they click a supplement name mention, which again opens the card overlay. The UI maintains context and doesn’t force full page reloads for minor interactions, creating a smooth browsing experience.
UX Flow Example (Mobile): On mobile, suppose a user opens COMPASS (maybe via a bottom nav icon). They see the search bar and a vertically stacked content: first a prominent featured article card to swipe through (like a mini carousel of top stories), then a header “Trending Now” with a vertical list of items (supplements or protocols). They tap the search bar and type; suggestions overlay and they tap a suggestion. The entire screen transitions to the supplement card. After reading, an “Add to Stack” action might pop a small confirmation at bottom. They hit back, returning to the main COMPASS screen. The design uses native-like transitions to make it feel app-like (e.g., sliding animations, easing).


Overall, the COMPASS UX is designed to feel like a blend of a knowledge portal and a dynamic dashboard. It draws inspiration from modern news apps, investment dashboards (for the stats view), and search engines, combining them in a health context. The interface is inviting for casual browsing but also efficient for targeted search. By ensuring consistency between desktop and mobile and focusing on responsive, quick interactions, COMPASS provides a credible and convenient experience that encourages regular engagement and trust in the data presented.


7. Data & Content Architecture


Behind the scenes, COMPASS is powered by a robust data architecture that pulls together various internal databases and external data sources. This unified architecture ensures that when a user sees a “supplement card” or a trending list, the information is accurate, up-to-date, and drawn from authoritative sources. The architecture also emphasizes modularity, so each pillar (COMPASS, VANTA Lab, LENS, AEGIS, etc.) shares data where needed but maintains clear boundaries and security. Below, we outline the key data components and content sources relevant to COMPASS:
Internal Data Sources (SILO Databases):
Supplement Database (Supplement DB): A structured repository of all supplements (and possibly key nutrients, compounds) recognized by SILO. For each supplement entry, it stores:
Canonical name and aliases: e.g., for Vitamin B3 it might store “Niacin” as primary with aliases like “Vitamin B3”, “Nicotinic Acid”. This fuels the search synonyms and ensures that user queries match the right entities.
Key attributes: default or typical dosage ranges, units (mg, IU, etc.), forms (capsule, powder), bioavailability flags (like whether certain forms are better absorbed).
Scientific links: references to primary research or meta-analyses (from LENS) supporting each major claimed benefit, along with an evidence level or score. For example, an entry might link Ashwagandha to 5 high-quality studies tagged for “stress reduction” with an evidence grade.
Tagging: categories or goals associated (e.g., Ashwagandha might be tagged “adaptogen, stress, anxiety”) to facilitate filtering and discovery.
Safety & regulatory notes: if applicable, notes on legal status in different regions, or if the supplement is banned in sport, etc.
Data use in COMPASS: The Supplement DB is the backbone for COMPASS’s search index. When a user searches a term, the system checks this DB for name or alias matches. It provides the canonical supplement entity to build the supplement card (ensuring we use the authoritative entry). It also supplies basic info like chemical properties or default dosing to display on cards. Additionally, by linking to research references, it allows the RAG engine to fetch related study snippets. The Supplement DB is shared read-only with other modules like VANTA Lab (for populating stack builder suggestions) and LENS (to connect studies to supplement entries), making it a central reference.
Protocol/Stack Database (Stack DB): A database storing user-created supplement stacks (protocols) as well as template protocols. Key content:
Stack definitions: Each protocol has metadata like title (e.g., “Sleep Optimization Stack”), description/goal, creation date, perhaps versioning if edited over time.
Stack items: The list of supplements (by supplement ID reference) in that stack, along with dosage, schedule, and form for each. This can be stored as structured JSON or relational child records.
Tags: Goals or categories the stack is associated with (like “sleep”, “immunity”) and whether it’s a curated template or user-generated.
Adoption and usage data: If a template, how many users have copied/used it. If user-generated, possibly whether it’s shared publicly. For any stack that a user is running, their adherence logs (check-ins, completion rates) might also link here or to a related table.
Adherence records: (possibly separate but related) timestamped logs of when user took or skipped doses in that stack, feeding into analytics.
Data use in COMPASS: Stack DB is crucial for generating trending protocols and usage stats:
For “Most copied protocols”, a query on this DB counts how many users have duplicated each template.
For popular stacks and their contents, aggregated views can find which supplements commonly occur together (e.g., find all stacks, group by supplement pairs).
When displaying a protocol in COMPASS, the data comes from this DB (supplement IDs resolved to names via Supplement DB). It also can supply community metrics, like average adherence for a given protocol, by looking at those adherence records.
The Stack DB shares data with the Analytics Engine (to correlate stack composition with outcomes) and with VANTA Lab for obvious reasons. COMPASS essentially leverages analytics-friendly views of this DB (e.g., a materialized view that directly provides “top supplements by usage count” or “trending stacks this month”).
If a protocol is flagged as public (shared by a user or curated), COMPASS can display it in the community browsing section with data from here. All of this is done respecting privacy (only aggregated or intentionally shared info surfaces).
User Analytics & Logging: While not a single “Analytics DB”, SILO likely collects various usage analytics (e.g., search queries, page views, user actions). For COMPASS-specific metrics:
Search logs: which terms are being searched and how often – could be used to identify trending searches even if the user didn’t ultimately add anything. This can feed into trending insights (e.g., “Spike in searches for Elderberry in October” might correlate with cold/flu season).
Click-through and add-to-stack events: tracking how often COMPASS suggestions lead to actions (like adding to stack), which is a KPI and also an input to improving recommendations (if certain trending items never get added, perhaps they’re more curiosity than intention).
These logs might be stored in a lightweight event store or simply as part of Supabase analytics or a tool like Logflare or Mixpanel integrated. While not directly a part of content, they are used to refine the COMPASS algorithms over time (and perhaps displayed in admin or not at all to users).
Brand Database (Brand DB): Houses information on supplement brands and products, integral to the AEGIS pillar. For each brand or product:
Brand profiles: name, manufacturing info, certifications (e.g., GMP, organic), any known third-party testing results.
Products: individual supplement SKUs with their ingredient list, form (capsule, powder), dosage per unit, etc. Possibly an average price or price range is stored here, or at least a reference price (maybe gleaned from partner data or input manually).
Quality flags: any red flags (failed tests, recalls, etc.) and positive flags (USP verified, etc.).
User ratings & feedback: if SILO allows users to rate or flag products, those might be recorded here.
Brand popularity metrics: possibly counts of how many users have a product from that brand in their stack.
Conflicts of interest: data such as if a research study was sponsored by a particular brand (this might be cross-referenced with LENS research DB).
Data use in COMPASS: The Brand DB contributes to COMPASS in several ways:
Supplement cards use it to display “best-quality brands” or recommended products for a given supplement. A query might fetch the top-rated or most-used brand for that supplement.
Price information in the supplement card (the “price band”) is derived from product records (e.g., if many products are listed, take a median price for a monthly supply).
Trending brand metrics, like “most popular brand overall” or “brand X is trending up in usage” could be shown in COMPASS leaderboards or stats (though user-facing emphasis is more on supplements and stacks, brand trends might be secondary).
If a featured article talks about product quality, it pulls data from Brand DB (like citing how many products have third-party certification).
Brand DB primarily feeds AEGIS (brand audit displays) but also shares relevant data to COMPASS (popularity metrics, quality highlights). Importantly, if a brand has a recall or regulatory issue, that info is flagged in Brand DB and COMPASS’s safety checks will use it to alert users (for example, if a trending supplement’s top brand had a recall, COMPASS might highlight that or adjust recommendations).
Research Database (Research DB): Powers the LENS pillar, but is key for COMPASS’s evidence integration. It contains:
Indexed studies and publications: Each entry with metadata like title, authors, journal, DOI, publication date.
Extracted content: The abstract, possibly full text snippets (key paragraphs), which are processed for NLP tasks.
Study scorecards: A quality rating for each study (perhaps A/B/C or numeric) based on methodology, sample size, etc..
Tags/Associations: Each study is tagged with relevant supplements, health goals, and biomarkers it pertains to. This is how the system knows which studies relate to creatine, for example.
Embeddings: Vector representations of study content for semantic search (pgvector or FAISS index). These allow RAG queries to find relevant passages.
User interactions: If users save studies or follow topics, that is stored here too (not core to COMPASS but LENS).
Data use in COMPASS: Research DB is what makes COMPASS’s trends intelligent and credible:
The RAG Engine queries this DB when building a supplement card to fetch a few highly relevant study conclusions about that supplement. For instance, for a supplement like Omega-3, the system might fetch the conclusion of a meta-analysis on omega-3 and heart health.
The quality scorecards from Research DB allow COMPASS to not just present any study, but highlight the best evidence. E.g., “highest-quality paper: 2019 RCT with 300 participants showed X” might be a line in the card.
Trending research content: COMPASS can use this DB to feature the latest research in the editorial section. If a new study is added and tagged “Vitamin D” and “immunity”, and if Vitamin D is trending in usage, the editorial feed can algorithmically suggest a spotlight like “New Research on Vitamin D & Immunity”.
The Research DB ensures that every claim or stat shown in COMPASS can, if needed, be traced back to a source (supporting SILO’s commitment to evidence and transparency). If a user clicks on a citation on a COMPASS card, it would pull from this DB to show the reference details or even the summary in LENS.
Integration: It’s shared with LENS obviously (for direct search of studies) and also with the NLP and RAG systems. It’s maintained by ingesting external feeds (discussed below under external sources).
Analytics Engine & Metrics (Logic Layer): Not a database per se, but the Analytics Engine is a service that processes data from the above DBs to produce higher-level insights. It might not store persistent data (or might use summary tables), but it’s responsible for things like:
Calculating “X% of users with your goal also take Y”.
Clustering usage patterns to identify trending stacks or anomalies (like “sudden increase in supplement Z usage this week”).
Generating the community stats that COMPASS displays (by scanning Stack DB and User DB demographics). For example, to show a stat like “Top 3 supplements among users age 50+”, the engine would combine User DB and Stack DB data.
The Analytics Engine might run on a schedule (say nightly for heavy computations, real-time for simple counters). It could populate a cache or table that COMPASS queries for the latest numbers.
It definitely shares outputs with COMPASS (trending data) and also triggers things on the user’s dashboard or notifications (like “The stack you copied is trending” as an engagement notification, possibly).
External Data Sources:
Regulatory and Safety Feeds: To keep information current, SILO integrates external data such as:
FDA recall alerts and safety warnings regarding supplements.
Alerts from NIH or other national health agencies about supplement ingredients (for example, NIH ODS notifications if a certain ingredient is newly considered unsafe).
European Health and Food Safety (e.g., EHPM or EFSA) advisories for international coverage.
These are ingested periodically (e.g., a daily or weekly job fetches updates) and get logged into either a dedicated table or into the Supplement/Brand DB as flags. For instance, if the FDA recalls a batch of turmeric supplements for contamination, the Brand DB entry for that product is updated and a “recall” flag is set.
Use in COMPASS: Such data is surfaced in COMPASS’s warnings on supplement cards (“Quality Alert: Product recall issued in July 2025 for contamination – check your brand”) or via news spotlights (“FDA issues advisory on high-dose biotin interference in lab tests”). It's part of COMPASS’s promise to keep users up-to-date on safety. This external feed ensures the platform isn’t siloed from real-world regulatory changes.
Supplement Product Metadata Feeds: Instead of manually entering every product detail, SILO can utilize public or commercial APIs/datasets:
For example, the NIH Dietary Supplement Label Database (if available via API) or industry datasets that list supplement products and their labels. These can provide ingredient lists, dosages, and possibly stock images of products.
E-commerce or affiliate feeds from partners (Amazon, iHerb, etc.) could provide price information and product availability. A licensed dataset might give average pricing for common supplements which is used in COMPASS to display “typical price”.
Use in COMPASS: By ingesting these, the Brand DB stays current with new products and pricing. It means when a user opens a card, the brand suggestions and price range are realistic and up-to-date without manual maintenance. If external feeds aren’t available initially, these may be added as the platform grows (hence “external: TBD” in planning, indicating partnerships or data acquisitions under consideration).
Research Publications Feed: Likely, SILO continuously expands the Research DB by pulling in new scientific literature:
Integration with PubMed or CrossRef APIs to get newly published studies on relevant topics (e.g., a job that queries PubMed for any new paper mentioning a supplement or known compound and then ingests and indexes it).
Possibly partnering with a service like Semantic Scholar or using arXiv for preprints to capture cutting-edge research.
These are processed by the NLP engine to extract key info and update the DB.
Use in COMPASS: ensures that the RAG summaries and evidence scores in the cards reflect the latest science. For example, if a major study comes out overturning previous knowledge about a supplement, the system can update the card’s summary or at least surface that new study. Also, COMPASS’s editorial content can be partly auto-driven by what new studies come in (e.g., a weekly “New Research Roundup” feature).
External Trend Data (Future Consideration): Down the line, COMPASS might incorporate trends from outside the SILO platform to enrich context:
Google Trends data for supplement search terms (to reflect general public interest beyond SILO’s user base).
Social media mentions (Twitter, Reddit) counts for certain supplements to spot viral trends (with caution and processing to avoid noise).
Industry sales data from supplement market reports.
While these are not confirmed, the architecture could accommodate them by treating them as additional inputs to the Analytics Engine. For example, if a supplement suddenly spikes on Google Trends, COMPASS could feature it as “Trending externally” even if within SILO it’s not yet popular – tipping users off to something brewing in the broader world. However, all external trend inclusion would be carefully vetted to maintain data quality and avoid promoting baseless fads.
Content Management System (CMS) for Editorial: The featured articles and spotlights are likely managed through an internal CMS or even just a table in the database where content is stored. SILO’s team can create an article (with images, text, references) and tag it (e.g., related supplements). This content is stored and then appears in COMPASS’s feed.
The CMS might simply be a schema in Supabase (with a table for articles, columns for title, body, author, date, etc., and maybe a JSON for media attachments) or a lightweight headless CMS integrated via API.
Use in COMPASS: The CMS content is pulled in alongside dynamic data. Since editorial content can mention specific supplements or stats, it might query the live data for the latest figures when rendering (for example, an article could include a shortcode that gets replaced with the current “#1 supplement this week”). But typically, it’s static content that the team updates regularly.
The architecture should allow non-engineers to update this content without code deployments – hence a CMS approach.
Architectural Design and Integration:
All these data sources flow through a carefully orchestrated pipeline:
The Input Layer (as defined in SILO docs) includes user inputs (which feed Stack DB, etc.) and external sources (which feed into Brand DB, Research DB, etc.).
The Processing Layer includes the NLP Engine, RAG Engine, and Analytics Engine. For COMPASS:
The NLP Engine processes new research text for summarization, tags, and quality scoring.
The RAG Engine is invoked for user queries or to pre-summarize popular topics.
The Analytics Engine compiles usage data and external trend data into digestible metrics.
The Storage Layer is primarily the Supabase PostgreSQL instance which houses the aforementioned DBs (User, Stack, Supplement, Brand, Research, etc.). Data linking between them is achieved via foreign keys or references (e.g., Stack items reference Supplement IDs; research references supplement IDs; brand product references supplement IDs).
Each database table has well-defined relationships and uses Row-Level Security (RLS) for user-specific data. For example, Stack DB entries for user’s personal stacks are only visible to that user, whereas template stacks or aggregated views are globally visible. COMPASS mostly deals in aggregated or public data, but when showing something like “Already in your stack” on a card, that check is done with RLS ensuring the user only sees their own stack membership.
Data Updates and Caching: Given that some data (like trending stats) can be computationally heavy, the system likely caches those. A service might compute daily trending metrics and store them in a cache table or Redis. COMPASS then simply reads that for the leaderboards to present near-real-time data with minimal load.
Data Scalability: The architecture anticipates growth: the Postgres with pgvector covers semantic search internally, but could be scaled out if needed (e.g., use an external vector DB or ElasticSearch for certain queries). The integration of Redis is already considered for caching search results and card data to handle high query volumes. Partitioning or indexing strategies are in place on key tables (like an index on Stack DB by supplement ID to quickly count usage).
Data Quality & Moderation: There might be processes to ensure data integrity:
A curation step for the supplement DB to avoid duplicate entries (aliases help here).
Mechanisms to handle user-generated stack names or descriptions to avoid inappropriate content in something that could appear in trending. Possibly require approval for public sharing.
Routine audits of the research DB tagging to ensure relevant studies are correctly linked to supplements.


In summary, COMPASS’s data and content architecture is a layered integration of SILO’s core databases with selective external feeds. It was built to ensure each piece of information is sourced from the appropriate authority: scientific claims from the Research DB, product info from the Brand DB, popularity from the Stack/User data, etc. The architecture supports COMPASS’s needs for fast search, multi-faceted data in the supplement cards, and dynamic updates as trends evolve, all while maintaining data governance (security and accuracy). This strong foundation is what allows COMPASS to deliver its features reliably and scale as usage grows.


8. Back-End Services & APIs


COMPASS’s back-end is designed as a modular set of services that work together to retrieve, enrich, and deliver data to the front-end. The architecture leverages SILO’s core infrastructure (Supabase/Postgres, serverless functions, caching) as well as specialized components (NLP, RAG microservices) to meet the product’s needs. Below is a breakdown of the key back-end elements and their roles:
Supabase Backend (Postgres + Auth + Edge Functions): SILO uses Supabase, which provides a managed PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication and authorization. This is the central data store for the platform, as described in the Data Architecture. For COMPASS specifically:
The Postgres database (with schemas for Supplement, Stack, Brand, etc.) is accessed either directly or via APIs to fetch the data that populates COMPASS results. Supabase’s row-level security ensures that any direct queries respect user permissions – however, many COMPASS queries are reading public or aggregate data, which can be exposed safely.
Supabase Auth handles user login and issues JWTs or access tokens that are used by COMPASS queries. For example, when a user calls the COMPASS search API, their token ensures they can only see what they’re allowed (mostly relevant if personalized info like “already in your stack” is included).
Edge Functions: These are serverless functions (likely written in Node.js or TypeScript given Supabase’s support, or possibly Go) that run on the edge (global CDN). They are used for custom logic that goes beyond basic CRUD queries. COMPASS relies on edge functions for the search orchestration and possibly for the microservices:
For instance, the /api/search?q=<term>&scope=compass endpoint is implemented as an Edge Function. When a request hits this endpoint, it triggers a function that authenticates the user, parses the query parameters, and then coordinates the search across multiple sources.
The edge function may call the database (using Postgres queries) for things like the Supplement DB search (using SQL with a trigram similarity match or ILIKE), and Stack DB query, etc., and also call out to any external service (like an Elasticsearch cluster for Brand DB if one is used, or the vector search).
Edge Functions are also used for smaller mutations or actions: e.g., the “Add to Stack” button might call a protected function that writes to the user’s stack safely (ensuring the user owns that stack, etc.).
The advantage of edge deployment is low latency for users globally, which is beneficial for interactive features like search suggestions.
Hybrid Search Service (Retrieval Layer): At the heart of COMPASS’s search is a hybrid retrieval approach:
Part of this is handled via SQL (for exact or trigram matching in Postgres) and part via vector similarity (for semantic search). Supabase now supports pgvector, so it’s possible the vector search is done in SQL as well (e.g., using embedding <-> query_embedding ORDER BY distance). However, for performance at scale, a dedicated vector index (like FAISS or an external service) might be used. The architecture mentions FAISS/pgvector interchangeably.
The search service (which could be the edge function itself or a separate microservice) thus likely does:
Text match query on Supplement DB: using trigram or ILIKE to find any supplement name that matches the query or its alias. Also possibly a similar approach on protocol titles.
Semantic query on vector index: using an embedding of the query to find related supplements even if not named (e.g., query “muscle power aid” would semantically match “Creatine” as per example). This uses a precomputed embedding table (maybe stored in Postgres with pgvector or in-memory FAISS).
Full-text or Elastic search on Brand DB for product names if query looks like a product or brand, or if a brand search is explicitly supported.
Research DB search: possibly the service also directly queries Research DB for studies if the scope includes articles or if needed for snippet retrieval. However, the RAG Engine step might handle that separately (see below).
Protocol search: likely done via the text search on protocol titles/descriptions in Stack DB (which could just be another SQL query).
The results from various sources are then merged. The architecture suggests they score each result (maybe using BM25 for text, and combined relevance for semantic) and return a unified list. The grouping into Supplements/Protocols/Articles likely happens by labeling results by type and then the front-end grouping, but the heavy lifting of retrieving relevant items is here.
This search service is stateless (it just queries and combines), which makes it easy to scale horizontally (multiple function instances can run for concurrent queries, connecting to the same DB back-end).
Microservices for Enrichment: After the initial search results are gathered, COMPASS uses a set of specialized microservices to enrich the data before sending to the client:
RAG Engine (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): This microservice takes context (like which supplement was selected) and uses the Research DB to generate a human-friendly summary. Concretely, given a supplement ID or name, it might:
Fetch top relevant study snippets (already done by search step with filter by supplement-ID).
Feed those snippets into an AI model (like GPT-3.5 or a smaller local model) along with a prompt to summarize the findings about that supplement.
Return a concise 2-3 sentence summary with possibly a couple of citation references. For instance, “Multiple studies show creatine improves muscle strength and power output. It is also being studied for cognitive benefits with some positive preliminary results.” The engine ensures the summary is neutral and evidence-based.
If using an external API like OpenAI, the system anonymizes the query (no user data in the prompt, only the context). Over time, this could shift to an internal model if cost/privacy require (the architecture allows switching between OpenAI or internal models).
The RAG engine might be implemented as a separate container or even an edge function if it’s lightweight. It likely runs asynchronously or in parallel so as not to slow down the whole response – possibly the search service calls it and awaits the result to add to the payload.
Analytics Engine Service: As part of enrichment, this service injects community stats relevant to the result. For example, for the supplement in question, it calculates or retrieves the figure “32% of SILO users log Creatine”. This implies the analytics engine has a precomputed stat of how many users use each supplement and how many total users, etc. It might simply do a quick count on the Stack DB or use a cached value.
This service might also add things like recent trend info (“+5% growth in last month”) if that’s included.
Essentially, it appends the relevant numbers to the JSON that will form the supplement card.
NLP Engine Service: Another enrichment step might involve the NLP engine analyzing text for context:
It could extract contraindications or warnings by scanning through aggregated research or a known side-effect database. Perhaps it has a knowledge base of known interactions (e.g., “St. John’s Wort interacts with SSRIs”) and if the supplement matches any, it returns that.
It might also do sentiment analysis over literature or user feedback to gauge consensus, though this is more experimental (the mention in the architecture is sentiment over literature, which could be used to say “majority of studies are positive/neutral” etc., but likely not shown to end-user except as confidence wording).
The NLP engine could also handle tasks like normalizing units (though in the description the front-end normalizes units, but initial suggestions may come from here).
This is likely implemented as a separate function or as part of the RAG service if combined.
These microservices are stateless and composable. The search orchestrator might call them in parallel after getting raw results. Or they might be chained: e.g., first get initial results, then for each top result call RAG/NLP concurrently and then aggregate.
GraphQL API Gateway: Once all data pieces are gathered (search results, enriched fields), the back-end composes a response. The architecture specifically mentions a GraphQL Composer that stitches fields into a single strongly-typed payload.
It suggests that the front-end might use GraphQL queries to fetch a supplementCard object with nested fields (like supplement info, research summary, stats, user-specific flags).
This GraphQL layer could be implemented via Supabase’s GraphQL support or a custom Apollo Server. However, given the multi-source nature, likely a custom GraphQL endpoint is used which internally calls the above services or the cached results.
The advantage of GraphQL here is the front-end can request only needed fields, and as the schema grows (say we add more fields to the card), older clients can remain compatible.
The GraphQL composer ensures the final JSON has a unified structure: e.g., json { "supplementCard": { "id": 123, "name": "Creatine Monohydrate", "summary": "3-sentence summary...", "usageStats": {"percentageUsers": 32, "rankOverall": 5}, "researchScore": "A", "alreadyInUserStack": false, "brands": [ { "name": "X Brand", "qualityScore": 9.1 }, ... ], "protocols": [ { "id": 55, "title": "Muscle Power Pack" } ], "warnings": ["Not for kidney issues"], ... } } and so on.
Row-Level Security (RLS) at the database is another safety net: for example, the GraphQL layer might fetch “is this supplement in user’s stack?” by querying Stack DB for that user. RLS ensures that query can only see that user’s data. The GraphQL composer or the underlying resolvers handle attaching the user’s JWT for those subqueries.
Caching Layer (Redis/Edge KV): To achieve fast response times and handle high load, COMPASS employs caching at multiple levels:
A short-term cache (30 minutes as noted) for supplement card results keyed by supplement slug or ID. So if “creatine-monohydrate” was requested, the fully composed card JSON is cached. Subsequent requests in the next 30 minutes return directly from cache, bypassing all the microservices. This is hugely beneficial for popular items or repeated searches.
This cache could be implemented with Redis (if deployed on a server) or an edge key-value store (like Cloudflare Workers KV or Vercel’s Edge config). The key design is that it’s globally distributed (if edge) or at least quick. Considering Supabase edge functions run in various regions, a distributed KV might make more sense so each edge can check cache locally.
Additionally, even smaller caches likely exist:
The search suggestions (top 8 results for common queries) could be cached.
The vector queries might cache embedding of frequent queries.
The external API calls (if any, like OpenAI) results can be cached for a short time since the same summary for the same supplement likely doesn’t need regeneration too often unless new studies come in.
Cache invalidation: when underlying data changes (like if a new major study is added for a supplement, or a significant change in usage stats), the cache for that item might be cleared proactively. Also, 30 min TTL ensures freshness reasonably well for rapidly changing usage stats.
APIs and Integration Points:
Search API: As described, REST endpoint /api/search or GraphQL query. This is the main entry for COMPASS queries from front-end.
Add to Stack API: Perhaps a GraphQL mutation or REST endpoint like /api/stack/add. This updates the Stack DB. The integration here is that, as soon as it succeeds, the Analytics Engine might recalc some personal metric or the Dashboard. Possibly websockets or revalidation could update the UI. But as far as COMPASS is concerned, it may trigger a refresh on the card to now show “in your stack”.
Content API: The featured articles might be fetched via an endpoint like /api/compass/content or simply served via the database (maybe Supabase storage or so). The front-end likely hits an endpoint to list articles or retrieve article content. This might be a straightforward GET from a public storage if articles are stored as Markdown/HTML in a bucket, or a select from a content table.
Inter-pillar APIs:
When COMPASS links to LENS or AEGIS data, it may call their respective services. However, since all data is in one database, often it might just query the needed info directly (with proper access rules). For example, for brand details, COMPASS could either call an AEGIS API or just query Brand DB if allowed. The modular nature is more conceptual since physically the data is accessible.
There might be dedicated GraphQL endpoints or namespaces (like a Lens query might call a different resolver).
If the architecture evolves, one could containerize each pillar’s logic and have them talk via internal APIs; currently, it seems more monolithic albeit logically separated.
Monitoring & Logging: All these services output logs/metrics (for latency, success rates, etc.). Tools would monitor the search response times, cache hit rates, etc., to ensure performance. If the RAG engine calls external AI, those calls are also monitored for cost and failures; timeouts are in place to not hang the whole response (maybe if AI fails, the card still returns but without the summary).
Scalability and Redundancy:
The stateless functions (search, RAG, etc.) scale horizontally automatically with load (the serverless platform can spin up more instances).
The stateful components (Postgres, Redis) are likely managed services that can scale vertically or in clusters (Supabase Postgres can scale up, and potentially in read-replica horizontally if needed).
A future consideration is the separation of read-heavy operations (like COMPASS queries) from write-heavy (like VANTA Lab logging). Using read replicas for the big SELECTs could keep performance high. Or an indexing service like Elastic for text search if Postgres alone becomes a bottleneck for search.
The architecture is cloud-agnostic enough – it uses standard technologies that can be containerized if moving off Supabase. The mention of containerizing RAG+insights stack for potential GPU usage suggests planning for more heavy ML workloads possibly moving to their own infra when needed.
Integrations with External Services:
The OpenAI API (if used for RAG) integration is encapsulated in the RAG microservice. The credentials and usage of that are controlled to avoid leaking sensitive info (with prompts scrubbed of PII).
OAuth integrations (like wearables mentioned in Phase 2) are more for VANTA Lab but not directly COMPASS. However, the back-end might incorporate some data from those (like trending metrics on health improvements).
If any external content or feed (like news RSS or such) is pulled for editorial, a service or cron job handles that and writes to content DB for team to review and publish.


In summary, the back-end of COMPASS is a blend of managed infrastructure and custom microservices:
It relies on Supabase Postgres for robust data storage and uses row-level security and auth to protect data.
It uses Edge Functions to implement the core logic like search and to interface with microservices.
Specialized engines (NLP, RAG, Analytics) run as microservices or functions that can be updated/improved independently (for example, swapping in a new model in the NLP engine doesn’t affect the rest of the system).
The API design (GraphQL/REST hybrid) gives flexibility to the front-end while optimizing what data is sent.
Caching and distributed deployment ensure low latency globally, crucial for an interactive tool like COMPASS.
This architecture is designed not only for current functionality but is extensible: new features like a Q&A chatbot or personalized recommendations could be added as new endpoints or sub-fields in GraphQL, using the same data sources and engines.


By adhering to this modern, scalable architecture, COMPASS can handle increasing loads (more users, more data) and can integrate future enhancements (like more AI or external data sources) without fundamental changes – it’s built to be robust and future-proof from an engineering standpoint.


9. Privacy, Security & Compliance


Privacy and security are foundational to the SILO platform and are particularly important for COMPASS, which deals with personal health-related data (e.g., supplement usage patterns) and community trends. The design follows a privacy-by-design approach and ensures compliance with data protection laws and industry regulations. Key practices and measures include:
User Data Privacy: All personal data in SILO is treated with strict confidentiality:
Row-Level Security (RLS): The database enforces that each user can only access their own data records. For example, when COMPASS fetches a stat like “already in your stack,” the query runs with the user’s identity and will only return true if that supplement is in their stack, not anyone else’s. There is no way for a user to query another user’s regimen or personal info through COMPASS or any pillar, as these checks are at the database engine level.
Anonymized Aggregation: All community trend data displayed in COMPASS is aggregated and stripped of personal identifiers. When we say “30% of users take supplement X,” the system never exposes who those users are. Leaderboards and trending protocols do not show who created or is using them, unless it’s a deliberately shared template. Even then, any user-shared protocol is attributed generically (e.g., “Community Template”) unless a user opts-in to attach their identity. This approach aligns with SILO’s stance of avoiding social features that could expose personal behavior.
No Personalization Leakage: If COMPASS personalizes content (like suggesting trends based on user profile), it’s done client-side or via secure server logic. For instance, if the homepage highlights “Trends in your demographic”, that computation happens with respect to aggregate data and the user’s attributes without exposing those attributes to other users.
Opt-In Data Use: SILO does not sell user data or use it for third-party advertising. Any use of data for improving the platform (like training a recommendation model) is done in an anonymized way or with explicit consent. The platform likely provides settings for users to opt-in or out of community benchmarks – e.g., a user could allow their anonymized data to contribute to benchmarks (default likely yes, but transparently communicated).
Data Encryption & Security:
Encryption in Transit and At Rest: All communications between client and server are protected by TLS (HTTPS), and sensitive data fields in the database are encrypted at rest. Supabase/Postgres data is stored on encrypted volumes. Additionally, any particularly sensitive fields (like a user’s health goal, or notes about symptoms) might be further encrypted or hashed before analytics use.
Authentication & Authorization: Access to COMPASS endpoints requires a valid authenticated session. Supabase Auth or a similar JWT-based mechanism ensures that every API call includes a token, and the back-end verifies it. Session management is handled carefully to prevent unauthorized use (short token lifetimes, refresh tokens secure, etc.). For instance, if a user is not logged in, they cannot query COMPASS’s internal APIs – the UI might allow browsing of some generic content, but anything personalized or detailed is gated.
Secure Cloud Infrastructure: The back-end runs on secure infrastructure with minimal attack surface. Edge Functions run in isolated sandbox environments. Direct database access is restricted (firewalled) such that only the application servers or authorized users (developers) can access it. Secrets (like API keys for third-party services, e.g., OpenAI) are stored securely (not in code, but in environment configs or vaults).
Regular Security Audits: The system will undergo periodic reviews – from code security audits (to catch vulnerabilities like injection attacks, though using parameterized queries in SQL and ORMs helps mitigate that), to dependency checks (ensuring libraries are up-to-date and patched). Given health data sensitivity, following best practices akin to HIPAA (even if not strictly a covered entity) is prudent – e.g., comprehensive logging of data access and admin actions for audit trails.
Compliance with Data Protection Laws:
GDPR and CCPA: SILO is designed to comply with GDPR (for EU users) and CCPA (for California) requirements. This includes providing users rights such as:
Data Export: Users can request an export of their data in a common format. For COMPASS, that might include their profile, their personal stack details, etc., but not aggregate data (since aggregate is not personal data).
Right to be Forgotten: Users can delete their account, upon which all personal data (profile, stack entries, logs) are deleted or anonymized in the system. The architecture ensures that deleting user data will not break aggregate stats; typically the counts would simply decrement.
Consent: When users provide personal information (like connecting wearable data or entering health goals), there’s clear consent given and an explanation of how it’s used.
The privacy policy will detail how community metrics are derived and reassure that no personal info is shared.
No Unauthorized Sharing: SILO doesn’t share user identifiable data with third parties. If any third-party analytics or monitoring services are used, they don’t receive raw user data. For example, internal analytics might count “daily active COMPASS users” but that is not tying to user identities beyond internal use.
Children’s Data: Likely the platform is intended for adult users (especially as it deals with health supplements), but if not, compliance with COPPA or similar would be needed. Probably not in scope, but mentioned if relevant.
Medical/Health Compliance:
Not Medical Advice: COMPASS provides information on supplements but is not a substitute for professional medical advice. The platform likely includes disclaimers in the UI (especially in COMPASS, where one might misconstrue trending protocols as recommended for them). For example, on a protocol card, a note might read “For informational purposes only. Consult a healthcare provider before making changes to your regimen.” This is important from a legal standpoint to avoid crossing into practicing medicine or making unapproved health claims.
Regulatory Scope: Dietary supplements are not as strictly regulated as pharmaceuticals, but any health-related platform should be careful with claims. SILO’s approach is to base statements on research with citations, which helps ensure that any efficacy claims are not just marketing. Still, to comply with FDA regulations on supplements:
The language avoids saying a supplement “will cure or treat” a disease unless authorized; instead it might say “associated with supporting X” and always cite evidence.
If users track outcomes, SILO avoids using that data to make generalized efficacy claims beyond what’s supported.
HIPAA: SILO as a direct-to-consumer platform is likely not a HIPAA-covered entity (unless it partners with healthcare providers or insurers later). However, it handles health-related data, so the team treats it with similar care. If in the future clinicians use it in practice (e.g., a clinician persona sharing info with a patient via SILO), SILO might need to consider HIPAA compliance or Business Associate Agreements. At present, focusing on robust encryption and access control already covers many HIPAA safeguards (like ensuring only the user and those they explicitly share with can see their health data).
Security Measures:
Access Controls: Internally, even within the dev team, access to production data is limited. Admin interfaces are secure and audited. For example, any admin view that might let a support engineer see data is protected and logged, and possibly even certain sensitive fields are masked.
Penetration Testing: The platform will undergo pen-testing to find vulnerabilities (like XSS in the front-end, SQL injection in the API, etc.). The use of parameterized queries and sanitization in the back-end as described helps prevent injection vulnerabilities.
DDoS and Abuse Protection: The architecture, being serverless and cached, can handle spikes, but also measures like rate limiting on the API (to prevent abuse of search or scraping of data) are in place. If an IP or user makes too many requests too fast, the system can throttle them gracefully.
Sensitive Data Handling in AI: When using external AI services for RAG or any processing, SILO is cautious. As explicitly noted, sensitive queries are anonymized when sent to external APIs. For example, if a user asks a question involving their personal condition, the system might strip out any personal identifiers or phrasing that ties it to them, sending only the core query (and possibly indicating it's hypothetical). Also, no user-specific data is included in training AI models without permission.
Audit Logs: For compliance and security, key actions can be logged in an immutable log. This could include user actions like exporting data or deleting account, and admin actions like data corrections. These logs help in forensic analysis if needed and also to demonstrate compliance with user requests (e.g., showing a record of data deletion on request).
Compliance with Supplement Industry Standards:
Labeling and Claims: If SILO publishes content (like editorial articles), it must ensure that any supplement claims are substantiated (which it does via citing research). It likely avoids any language that would get into regulatory trouble (like claiming to “treat” diseases).
Third-Party Verification: The inclusion of COAs (Certificates of Analysis) and quality scores for products suggests SILO respects and propagates standards for product quality. If it uses third-party logos or certifications, it does so with permission and accuracy.
User Consent for Health Data: When linking wearable data or asking users to input health metrics, SILO will explicitly ask for consent (like “Allow SILO to use your health data to provide insights”). This not only is good practice but sometimes legally required (especially in EU – that would be sensitive data under GDPR needing explicit consent).
Transparency and User Control:
Privacy Policy & Terms: The platform provides a clear privacy policy that describes what data is collected and how it’s used (community trends, personal recommendations, etc.). It also clarifies that aggregate trends cannot be back-traced to individuals (given how data is handled).
Controls: Users likely have settings to control what emails or notifications they get (compliance with CAN-SPAM, etc.), whether their anonymized data contributes to research (some platforms let users opt out of even anonymized aggregation if they want).
Data Retention: The system retains personal data only as long as necessary. If a user becomes inactive, data might be retained for a period for their convenience if they return, but the user can request deletion anytime. Aggregate stats might keep their contributions but in a non-identifiable way, which is generally allowed even after deletion since it’s not personal data at that point.
In essence, SILO’s COMPASS is built with a strong trust framework:
Technically, it uses modern security measures (encryption, RLS, secure authentication) to guard data.
Practically, it limits the data that leaves the system (no selling, minimal sharing to third-party services, and when needed, done carefully).
Policy-wise, it follows privacy laws and ethical guidelines, giving users control and transparency.
And culturally, SILO positions itself as privacy-centric (as even stated: “Transparent and Privacy-Centric Design – SILO does not sell user data… and all trends are anonymized”), which is a selling point in an industry where user trust is paramount.


By adhering to these privacy, security, and compliance measures, COMPASS not only avoids legal pitfalls but also reinforces its credibility and integrity, which are key to retaining users (especially when dealing with personal health decisions).


10. Metrics & KPIs


To ensure COMPASS is delivering on its promises and to identify areas for improvement, a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics will be tracked. These metrics cover user engagement, quality of recommendations, and business outcomes. Below are the primary metrics, along with their relevance:
User Engagement Metrics: These metrics indicate how frequently and deeply users interact with COMPASS:
Monthly Active Users (MAU) of COMPASS: The number of unique users who use COMPASS features (search, browse, etc.) within a month. This shows the reach of the discovery feature among the SILO user base. A high MAU means COMPASS is integral to users’ experience, whereas a low MAU might indicate users are not finding or valuing it.
Daily Active Users (DAU) / Daily Sessions: How many users engage per day and how often. If COMPASS offers fresh content (like daily trending updates or articles), we’d expect a healthy DAU as users come back regularly to see “what’s new”.
Session Length on COMPASS: The average time spent in the COMPASS section per session. Longer sessions could imply users are reading articles or exploring multiple trends, which is positive (assuming it’s not due to confusion). For example, an average session of 5-10 minutes might indicate users are reading a couple of cards or an article each time.
Pages/Interactions per Session: How many different items a user interacts with in one visit (e.g., number of supplement cards opened, or leaderboards viewed). A higher number suggests sticky content – the user didn’t just search one thing and leave, they explored multiple.
Feature Adoption Metrics: These track which features of COMPASS are being utilized:
Search Query Volume: Total number of search queries executed in COMPASS per day/week. Growth in query volume would indicate increasing user curiosity or habit of using COMPASS as a search engine for supplements.
Top Searched Terms: (Not exactly a KPI, but a metric to watch) – could inform content creation (if many search for “vitamin C”, ensure content is rich there, or if unusual search terms appear, maybe the database is missing something).
Supplement Card Views: How many supplement card opens occur (from search or browsing). This can be aggregated and also broken down per supplement to see which are most viewed (which is itself a trend metric for internal use – often aligning with trending popularity).
Protocol Card Views/Template Copies: How often do users view detailed protocol information and then copy or save a protocol to their own stack. The Protocol Copy Rate (number of copies / number of views) is a KPI because it indicates how compelling the featured protocols are. If low, maybe the protocols aren’t appealing or need better presentation.
Featured Article Reads: Track views or scroll completion of editorial content. If an article is long, maybe track % scrolled to estimate if it’s read fully. This measures the success of the content strategy. If editorial pieces have low readership, maybe users prefer the data over prose, or content topics need adjustment.
Leaderboard Interaction: Are users clicking on items from the leaderboards/trending lists? We can measure click-through rates of those items. A high CTR would mean the leaderboard is effectively directing user interest (good, it’s doing its job).
Conversion & Cross-Feature Metrics: These tie COMPASS activity to other pillars – essentially measuring how effectively COMPASS drives users to take beneficial actions:
Add-to-Stack Conversions: The number of times users add a supplement to their regimen directly from COMPASS (and percentage of card views that lead to an add). This is a critical metric. A high conversion suggests COMPASS is successfully influencing user decisions (in a positive way, hopefully evidence-based). For instance, if 20% of supplement card views result in an add, that’s quite successful. If it’s 1%, maybe users are just browsing and not acting, which might prompt investigation (are they not convinced or just curious?).
New Stack Creations via COMPASS: How many new stacks or protocols were started as a result of COMPASS discovery. For example, a user reads an article and then creates a new stack or substantially modifies their existing one. This can be hard to attribute, but perhaps surveys or indirect metrics (like a spike in certain supplement additions after a trending highlight).
Retention Impact: Compare retention or engagement of users who use COMPASS vs those who don’t. Hypothesis: users who engage with COMPASS might stick around longer (since they find ongoing value). This can be an internal metric: e.g., 3-month retention rate of users who used COMPASS at least twice vs those who never did. If significantly higher, it’s a selling point that COMPASS drives engagement and retention.
Content Effectiveness Metrics: Evaluate the quality and relevance of COMPASS content and intelligence:
Recommendation Accuracy / Satisfaction: Although more qualitative, we could gather user feedback via in-app surveys or ratings on how helpful they found a COMPASS suggestion or article. For example, after viewing a supplement card, a pop-up could ask “Was this information useful?” with a rating. The average rating can be a KPI for content satisfaction.
Trending Accuracy & Freshness: On the backend, measure how often trending lists update with genuinely new items. If a “trending” list is static for too long, it might indicate stagnation or overly conservative thresholds. Ideally, trending protocols rotate as usage patterns shift. We might set a metric like “number of new items entering top 10 per month”. This ensures the trend algorithm is capturing changes (though not too volatile).
Latency and Performance: The average response time for search queries and card loads is an important technical KPI. For a good UX, we might set targets like “Search suggestions appear in <200ms” and “Supplement card fully loads in <1000ms on average”. Consistently meeting these ensures a smooth user experience, which correlates with higher usage.
Error Rates: Monitor how often any errors occur in COMPASS features (failed search queries, card data failing to load, etc.). This should be minimal, but tracking it helps maintain reliability. A near-zero error rate is the goal, aside from graceful handling like “no results found” which is not an error but a user-facing message.
Community Health Metrics: These metrics pertain to the quality and impact of community-driven data:
Diversity of Participation: Ensure that a broad set of user data contributes to trends, not just a small core of power users. If only 5% of users are logging most data, trends might be skewed. A metric could be “percentage of active users whose data is represented in at least one community trend metric.” The higher, the more representative the intelligence.
Privacy Metrics: Perhaps track that there have been zero privacy incidents or breaches as a KPI (a bit binary, but crucial). Also, monitor if any user complaints about privacy arise (e.g., no one should feel their data was exposed through a trend stat).
Business & Monetization Metrics: Though COMPASS is more of an engagement feature, it can indirectly or directly tie to revenue:
User Upgrade Rate: If there’s a premium tier (Phase 3 mentions premium features), measure if COMPASS usage correlates with conversions to premium. For instance, premium might offer deeper analytics or early access to certain trends. If users who frequently use COMPASS show a higher upgrade percentage, that’s a metric to highlight investor-wise (COMPASS drives monetization).
Affiliate Link Clicks/Purchases: If COMPASS includes affiliate purchase links for supplements (as part of smart shopping integration), track how many clicks and conversions occur from those. E.g., “Purchase link clicks from COMPASS supplement cards per month”. If each trending supplement card has a “buy” option, that could be a revenue stream. KPIs would be conversion rate of those, and revenue generated.
Traffic & Growth: If parts of COMPASS (like certain articles or limited features) are available to non-logged-in users (to attract new signups), track the incoming traffic. For example, “Unique visitors to COMPASS public pages” or SEO ranking of COMPASS content. This can gauge brand reach and lead generation. Although primarily COMPASS is in-app, the editorial content could serve as a funnel if shared externally.
Outcome/Effectiveness Metrics: Harder to measure but very meaningful:
User Outcomes: Are users achieving better health outcomes or satisfaction because of COMPASS? For example, measure changes in user behavior such as “% of users who report meeting a health goal after following a COMPASS-suggested protocol” or “average improvement in a self-tracked metric after using a suggested stack.” These require user input and possibly long-term studies. But a simpler proxy might be adherence – if COMPASS helps users find routines that work for them, they might stick to them more. So one could compare adherence rates: stacks that came from COMPASS suggestions vs stacks users built entirely on their own. If COMPASS-guided choices have higher adherence or longevity, it indicates COMPASS is recommending feasible, effective protocols.
Support Load Reduction: Possibly a metric for internal use – if COMPASS effectively educates users, they might ask fewer questions to support or in community forums. If such channels exist, a reduction in those or common question types could indirectly measure how well COMPASS content preemptively answers user needs.


For each metric, targets will be set. For instance:
Achieve X% of SILO users engaging with COMPASS monthly by 6 months post-launch.
25% of supplement card views result in “Add to Stack” within first year.
Average search-to-result time under 0.5s.
User satisfaction rating for COMPASS features above 4/5.


Regular dashboards will be created to monitor these KPIs. The team will review them monthly or quarterly to assess progress:
If engagement is low, investigate UI discoverability or content relevance.
If conversion is low, maybe the info is overwhelming or not persuasive enough – possibly adjust the design or highlight top benefits more.
If a certain feature like editorial content isn’t getting traction, pivot content strategy or placement.
If trends are not shifting over time, perhaps the user base is small or static – which might push marketing efforts to grow users or to tweak how trends are surfaced (maybe highlight more niche trends to keep it dynamic).




By closely tracking these metrics, the COMPASS team can iterate to ensure the product is fulfilling its goals of engaging users, guiding better decisions, and providing value that stands out. These KPIs also provide concrete evidence to investors and stakeholders about COMPASS’s contribution to SILO’s overall success (for example, if COMPASS drives a significant portion of supplement purchases or premium upgrades, that’s a direct ROI demonstration).


11. Roadmap (0–12 Months)


The roadmap for COMPASS is structured in phases that align with SILO’s broader product development timeline (which spans an initial MVP and subsequent feature expansions). Over 0–12 months, COMPASS will progress from basic functionality to a robust, intelligent discovery platform. Below is the roadmap with approximate timelines:


Month 0–3: Phase 1 – Core COMPASS MVP
Objective: Launch the essential discovery features alongside SILO’s MVP, enabling basic exploration and content delivery.
Searchable Database Launch: Implement the core search functionality for supplements and protocols. At this stage, the search supports exact matches and basic suggestion grouping (supplements and protocols). Semantic search via pgvector may be rudimentary or limited to a predefined synonym set initially.
Basic Supplement Cards: Develop the initial version of the supplement card interface. In Phase 1, it includes fundamental info: supplement description, any available research summary (likely manually curated or a static summary due to lack of fully integrated RAG), and perhaps one or two community stats if readily available. The card shows user actions (Add to Stack) but minimal dynamic content.
Featured Content via CMS: Set up a simple CMS or mechanism to display “Featured stacks and supplement spotlights” on COMPASS. This likely involves creating a few static pages or cards that the team can edit (for example, a weekly spotlight on a particular supplement and a short write-up).
Integration & UI Polishing: Ensure COMPASS is accessible from the main navigation and that the UI is clean on both desktop and mobile. It might not have full filtering or all sections yet, but the core navigation is in place.
Internal Release & Testing: By end of Month 3, COMPASS (Basic) is live for internal testing or a closed beta, with feedback focusing on search accuracy and UI clarity. Some content (like at least 5–10 featured articles or spotlights, aligning with curated templates for synergy) is prepared so the section looks populated.
Deliverable at end of Q1: COMPASS Basic – Users can search the supplement/protocol database and see featured content. For example, a user can find “Vitamin D” in search and read a spotlight article about it or a basic card describing it. This fulfills the must-ship requirement of a searchable DB and basic content, aligning with SILO’s Core Web MVP milestone.


Month 4–6: Phase 2 – Enhanced Trends and Personalization
Objective: Increase the value of COMPASS by introducing real-time trend metrics, richer content, and some personalization hooks.
Trending Stats & Leaderboards: Implement the “COMPASS Upgrade” features that were planned for Phase 2. This includes developing the back-end analytics to calculate metrics like most copied stacks, most logged supplements, etc., on a periodic schedule. The front-end will now have sections for “Trending Supplements” and “Trending Protocols” leaderboards with dynamic data, updated perhaps daily or weekly.
Anonymized Usage Overlays: Introduce visuals or indicators on supplement cards about usage (“user activity overlays” refers to possibly showing graphs or comparative benchmarks). E.g., a small chart of how the popularity of a supplement changed over months, or a note “Up X% this quarter.” This makes the cards more engaging and informative.
Expanded Content & CMS: More editorial content is added. Perhaps a cadence is established: one featured article per week and a couple of short spotlights per week. The CMS is refined to allow scheduling posts and tagging them. Also, incorporate regulatory news feed: by this phase, if any FDA or safety alerts system was planned, initial integration could show up as short announcements in COMPASS (for instance, a sidebar “Safety Alerts” widget).
Basic Filtering & Categories: Add the ability to filter or browse by categories/goals. For example, users can select “Focus on: Immunity” and see trending supplements and protocols in that category. This might involve tagging content and linking with LENS topics.
Personalized Highlights (early stage): While full personalization is more Tier 2, by month 6 we could include small personalized touches: on the COMPASS main page, if the user has a particular goal set in their profile (say “muscle gain”), a section might highlight “Popular in muscle gain: Protein, BCAAs, Creatine…” which is a filtered view just for their context. This leverages user profile data lightly to sort the trends relevant to them.
Performance Tuning: Based on initial usage, work on improving search speed and result quality. Possibly incorporate the semantic search in this phase if not in MVP, to handle the increased query volume and variety.
Mobile Optimization: With more features on the page, ensure the mobile layout is adapted for new elements like leaderboards (e.g., maybe only top 5 show on small screen with a “see more”).
Community Template Library: Possibly allow the first user-generated content in COMPASS: maybe the ability for users to mark their stack as “public template”. By month 6, if enough users are on the platform, we might start showcasing a few community-contributed protocols in a library section (with curation). If user base is still small, this might hold off until more data is present.
Milestone at end of Q2: COMPASS is now a truly dynamic discovery hub. Users logging in can see what’s trending and have more reasons to return frequently. For example, Jane logs in and sees on COMPASS that a “Calm Sleep Stack” is trending this week; she reads about it and perhaps tries it. This phase fulfills the roadmap item of trending stacks and usage metrics and expands COMPASS into the interactive layer envisioned.


Month 7–9: Phase 3 – Intelligence & Premium Integration
Objective: Finalize advanced intelligence features, integrate AI for research summarization, and prepare COMPASS for any premium-tier offerings.
NLP + RAG Integration: Deploy the full NLP and RAG Engine capabilities within COMPASS. Now supplement cards will feature the 3-sentence AI-generated research summary we planned, drawn from LENS data, with citations. Semantic search improves – users can search questions, not just keywords, and get meaningful results (this might involve a Q&A interface or at least better handling of natural language queries).
Quality Scorecards & Indicators: Incorporate study quality indicators into COMPASS where appropriate. For example, a supplement card might show an “Evidence Quality: High (based on 10 RCTs)” label, or trending protocols might have an icon if they’re “clinically inspired” vs “anecdotal”. These draw on the LENS scorecards implemented in Tier 2.
Advanced Insights: Some of the analytics from Tier 2 intelligence might reflect in COMPASS as premium features. For instance, a premium user viewing a supplement card might see a “Stack Effectiveness Score for You” which uses user similarity modeling (Tier 2) to predict how well that supplement might work given their profile. Or community comparisons like “Top 10% outcome for energy increase” if data available.
Personalized Trend Digests: Possibly introduce weekly email or in-app digests (“In Phase 2 we did research digest, now maybe trending digest”). A user could opt to receive “What’s new on COMPASS this week” – highlighting new studies, trending supplements in their interest areas. This keeps engagement high.
Premium Content & Partitioning: If SILO is launching a premium tier around the end of Phase 3, COMPASS might contribute exclusive content or features to it. For example:
Exclusive deep-dive articles or reports (e.g., a monthly “insider trend report” only for premium).
More granular data: basic users see top 5 trending supplements, premium can see top 20 and filter by demographics, etc.
Early access to new features like the Q&A chatbot or interactive recommendation wizard (just as hypothetical enhancements).
UI/UX Refinement and Polish: With all major features in, do a UX review and refinement. Ensure the interface isn’t cluttered – maybe introduce more guided tours or tooltips for advanced features. Optimize any slow parts (like if RAG responses are slow, maybe load them async after the card or improve caching).
Beta to Launch: By month ~9 (around the end of this phase), SILO likely prepares for a public launch. All five pillars including COMPASS should be fully functional and integrated. This period includes rigorous testing, bug fixing, and possibly scaling up infrastructure in anticipation of user growth at launch.
Milestone at end of Q3: Public Launch of SILO (web platform) – COMPASS at launch is a highlight feature distinguishing SILO from basic supplement trackers. Press or marketing might tout “SILO’s COMPASS uses community trends and AI to guide your supplement choices in real-time.” All core features – search, interactive cards with enriched data, trending insights, and integrated research summaries – are live.


Month 10–12: Post-Launch Enhancements & Growth
Objective: Monitor, iterate, and begin exploring next-tier features and wider integration after initial launch.
User Feedback Loop: Collect user feedback and usage data from the launch. Identify which COMPASS features are most loved or underutilized. Quick iterations might be planned: e.g., if users request the ability to ask free-text questions (“Which supplement is best for migraine?”), consider adding a COMPASS Q&A search mode using RAG (if not already there).
Mobile App Planning: While the initial release was desktop-web focused (mobile via responsive web), by this time we might start designs for native mobile apps (if slated after 12 months). This includes ensuring COMPASS features can be nicely embedded in a mobile app (maybe even an offline mode for content?).
Community Features (Careful Expansion): Possibly consider adding light community interaction based on comfort post-launch. For instance, allowing commenting on articles or upvoting protocols. This would increase engagement but must be done in a controlled way to maintain the privacy-first stance. In months 10-12, we might prototype these internally or launch in a small user group to test viability.
External Data Feeds Integration: Evaluate and possibly integrate additional external data (discussed in Future Enhancements). For example, by month 12, perhaps pilot an integration with a partner: say, pulling top-selling supplements data from an e-commerce partner to compare with SILO’s trending (maybe for premium users or internal analysis).
Scaling and Optimization: If usage is growing, invest time in scaling infrastructure: e.g., add more caching where needed, optimize the vector search (maybe move heavy computations to a background job or nightly pre-compute for frequently asked queries).
Internationalization Prep: If going global is a target after year 1, start planning localization of COMPASS content (translating UI and maybe key articles). This could be on the roadmap if expansion to non-English markets is foreseen. Perhaps not in first 12 months, but preparation could start (like structuring content so it’s translatable).
Hardware Integration (Longer-term, likely beyond 12 mo): SILO mentioned hardware (smart dispenser) beyond the initial release. In context of COMPASS, that might not have direct impact except possibly collecting more data for trending (like which supplements get dispensed most). That’s beyond 12 months, but mentioning that planning for such integration might begin after initial launch stabilizes.


By the end of 12 months, COMPASS should be in a mature state:
It will have gone through MVP, gathered trend data as userbase grows, and implemented AI-driven features.
The focus would shift to sustaining content quality (regular updates), optimizing the experience, and driving user growth through the compelling nature of the feature.


Summary Timeline:
Q1 (0-3 mo): Build and release COMPASS Basic (search + basic content).
Q2 (4-6 mo): Add trending stats, leaderboards, expanded content.
Q3 (7-9 mo): Integrate AI summarization, advanced analytics, prep for public launch and possibly premium. Launch at ~month 9.
Q4 (10-12 mo): Post-launch improvements, feedback-driven tweaks, and groundwork for next-gen features (mobile app, social elements, more data sources).


This roadmap ensures that COMPASS’s development is incremental and user-driven – delivering immediate value early (even in basic form) and layering on the sophisticated capabilities as data and user engagement ramps up. It also illustrates to investors that there is a clear plan to go from an MVP to a differentiated, AI-enhanced product within a year, balancing quick wins with ambitious features.


12. Future Enhancements (AI & External Feeds)


Looking beyond the first year, several opportunities can propel COMPASS to new levels of intelligence, personalization, and comprehensiveness. These future enhancements would keep COMPASS at the cutting edge of trend analysis and user guidance:
Conversational AI Assistant (Chat-based COMPASS): Leverage large language models in a controlled way to create a chatbot interface for COMPASS. Users could ask complex questions in natural language – for example, “I’m a 45-year-old male with high cholesterol looking to improve heart health, what supplements should I consider?” – and the assistant would use the RAG pipeline to answer with personalized suggestions and references. This goes beyond current search by synthesizing information across supplements, protocols, and even lifestyle advice. The bot could clarify follow-up questions, making the experience interactive. Ensuring factual accuracy and citing sources (to maintain trust) would be crucial; the groundwork laid by the RAG engine would support this. This feature could become a premium offering or an included tool, and would embody SILO’s AI-forward vision.
Predictive Trend Forecasting: Implement machine learning models that analyze historical usage data and external signals to forecast supplement trends. For instance, using time-series analysis (already part of Tier 2 plans), COMPASS could predict “Supplements likely to trend next month” or alert users that “Interest in Elderberry is expected to spike this winter.” This involves modeling seasonal patterns, media influence (if we integrate social media trends), and user sentiment. It could be presented as a “Trend Radar” feature – valuable for both consumers (to stay ahead) and brands (market foresight). Technically, this might involve ARIMA or Prophet models on usage data, or even training a custom model that incorporates Google Trends and other data as features.
Deeper Personalization & Similar User Insights: Expand the personalization by using user similarity modeling and clustering. For example, COMPASS could identify a user’s “peer group” (based on profile, goals, and stack) and then tailor the discovery feed: “Users like you are showing increased interest in Supplement X.” Or provide a section “Recommended for You” that surfaces protocols popular among similar individuals. This requires accumulating enough user data and then applying clustering algorithms or collaborative filtering. Over time, as the user base grows, these personalized trend recommendations could become a standout feature – each user’s COMPASS feed might be unique to their context (while still drawing from global data).
Integration of External Health Data Feeds: Beyond regulatory alerts, many external data sources can enrich COMPASS:
Clinical Trials & Publications Feeds: Automatically incorporate results from newly published clinical trials or meta-analyses. If, say, a major trial on a supplement concludes, COMPASS could immediately flag that supplement with a “New Evidence” tag and update its research summary. One could partner with databases like ClinicalTrials.gov to even show if a supplement is currently under study (forward-looking info for enthusiasts).
User-Generated Reviews (External): Potentially aggregate reviews or discussions from external platforms (like if integration with forums or Reddit became possible in a privacy-conscious way). For instance, if there is a surge in mentions of a new supplement on social media, COMPASS might highlight it as “emerging interest” even if within SILO it’s not yet widely used.
Nutritional and Biochemical Databases: Link to deeper chemical and nutritional data (e.g., structures from PubChem, metabolic pathways from KEGG). This would cater more to power users or researchers, turning COMPASS also into a reference hub. For example, on a supplement card, a future enhancement might allow viewing the molecular structure or how it’s metabolized in the body, pulled from these databases.
Market Price Feeds: Connect to real-time price data sources or shopping APIs so that COMPASS can show current prices or availability across multiple retailers for a given supplement. This turns COMPASS into not just an information portal but a smart shopping assistant as well (enhancing the “Smart Shopping” value prop). It could even alert users if a trending supplement is on sale or if a product recall happened (by tying into shopping data).
Expanded Community Features (Opt-in Social Layer): Introduce safe social features that amplify community intelligence:
A discussion/Q&A thread for supplements or protocols, moderated and possibly anonymized if needed (users could post questions like “Did anyone experience side effects with this?” and others can respond). This would create user-generated content that stays within the SILO ecosystem. Advances in moderation AI could help keep these discussions high-quality and spam-free.
Protocol sharing and collaboration: Users might team up or share progress on protocols. E.g., “5 people are currently following this detox protocol – join a group to share insights”. This fosters community learning. It would require careful privacy (maybe pseudonyms or alias system), but can increase engagement and collective data (those group chats could yield insights on outcomes).
AI-Driven Content Curation: Use AI to assist in writing editorial content or summarizing community trends. For instance, an AI model could draft a weekly “COMPASS Trend Report” summarizing what changed in the last week (e.g., “Ashwagandha overtook Melatonin as the #1 sleep supplement as winter approaches…”). The editorial team could then review and publish these quickly, scaling content output. This blends automated analysis with human insight for quality control.
Integration with Wearables and Outcomes: As VANTA Lab ingests more wearable data (sleep scores, HRV, etc.), COMPASS could integrate aggregated outcome trends. For example, “Users taking Magnesium saw on average +10% sleep quality improvement vs those who don’t.” That kind of insight (which might come from Analytics Engine’s deeper correlation analysis) would be displayed in COMPASS, connecting supplement trends directly to outcome trends. It requires careful statistical work (to avoid spurious correlations), but it would be powerful: trends not just in usage, but in results. This ties back to the idea of “Stack Effectiveness Scoring” – broadening it beyond individual to community level.
Multi-Modal Data Integration (Images, etc.): Possibly allow image-based discovery. For example, a user could take a photo of a supplement bottle, and COMPASS (via computer vision) identifies it and pulls up the supplement card (this tech partly overlaps VANTA’s barcode scanning, but could be extended). Or scanning a lab report or blood test result to get supplement suggestions (a stretch, likely under VANTA’s scope, but COMPASS could surface trending supplements for that marker).
Hardware & IoT Integration: When SILO’s hardware (like a smart dispenser) comes into play, COMPASS can incorporate data from it. If the device notices certain supplement consumption patterns, that could feed into trending data. Also, the hardware could have an interface (screen or app integration) that surfaces COMPASS insights contextually (e.g., “This morning’s supplement is in the top 5 most taken – you’re on track with a popular regimen” – a bit playful but adds a community sense).
Gamification & Achievement Insights: Building on basic gamification in Phase 2, in the future COMPASS might highlight personal milestones relative to the community. For example, “You are in the top 10% of consistent supplement loggers – streak 90 days!” or awarding badges for exploring content (“Trend Watcher: read 5 trend reports”). While gamification should remain subtle (to keep SILO’s serious tone credible), some users enjoy benchmarks and achievements. This can drive more exploration (like a badge for “First protocol copied from COMPASS” encourages trying that feature).
Professional & Enterprise Features: Introduce specialized COMPASS views or data products:
For clinicians: a mode that perhaps integrates with EHRs or allows them to input a patient’s meds and see supplement interaction warnings (beyond current scope, but leveraging the knowledge base for clinical decision support).
For brands: a premium dashboard with aggregated trend data, maybe even competitor comparisons (fully anonymized, of course). This could be a monetization route – selling industry insights reports drawn from COMPASS data, as long as it doesn’t compromise user privacy. It’s like market research packaged product. (Would only be done if scale is sufficient and data anonymity guaranteed.)
Localization and Regional Trends: As SILO expands globally, adapt COMPASS to show region-specific trends. What’s trending in Europe may differ from the US. The platform could auto-detect user region and present relevant content (with possibility to switch region to explore globally). It would also incorporate region-specific supplement data (e.g., certain ingredients allowed in one country, banned in another – the regulatory feed expansion will help highlight that).
Augmented Reality (far future brainstorming): If one imagines a future AR application, a user could point their phone camera at a supplement store shelf and have a COMPASS overlay showing which products on the shelf are highest rated or trending, using the brand/product database. While far-fetched for now, it’s a conceivable use of the data in a physical context – blending COMPASS intelligence with real-world shopping.
Each of these enhancements will be evaluated for feasibility and impact:
AI: We’ll incrementally test AI features for reliability. Conversational AI, for instance, might roll out as a beta for premium users first to ensure it provides correct advice with citations.
External feeds: Need to vet data sources for quality. For example, social media trends can be noisy, so any ingestion would use NLP to filter signal from noise.
Privacy: As we consider community features or data sharing with brands, we will maintain our privacy-first stance. Any such move likely will be opt-in or aggregated to a level that individuals are completely unidentifiable.


By keeping an eye on these future possibilities, the COMPASS team can ensure the platform remains innovative and avoids stagnation. The goal is for COMPASS to not just react to trends, but shape the future of how people discover and evaluate supplements – integrating the best of AI and community data in a trustworthy manner. These enhancements, when strategically implemented, will solidify COMPASS’s position as a unique, invaluable tool in the health and wellness domain, and they offer exciting avenues for differentiation and growth in the years ahead.


13. Risks & Mitigations


Building and operating COMPASS comes with several risks that need proactive management:
Risk 1: Misinformation or Inaccurate Guidance
Description: There is a risk that COMPASS could inadvertently spread misinformation – for example, highlighting a trending supplement that isn’t actually effective or is based on a fad, or an AI-generated summary that misinterprets a study. Since users may make health decisions based on COMPASS, inaccuracies could harm trust or even user health.
Mitigation:
Evidence-Based Safeguards: Every piece of information in COMPASS is tied to cited research or real data. By design, the platform avoids making unsupported claims – e.g., the RAG summaries cite sources, and trending lists are purely data-driven (popularity, not “we think this is good”).
Expert Oversight: In the short term, SILO’s team (which likely includes medical or scientific advisors) will review content especially in editorial and any AI outputs for correctness. For critical areas (like safety warnings or top protocol suggestions), have a domain expert validate the logic and content periodically.
User Feedback Loop: Provide a mechanism for users to flag content that seems wrong or questionable. If a supplement card says something a user knows (or thinks) is incorrect, they should be able to report it. The team can then investigate and correct any misinformation quickly.
Scope of Advice: Keep the tone informative rather than prescriptive. Phrasing like “studies suggest X may help” vs. “you should take X for Y” reduces the chance of misinterpretation. And always include disclaimers about consulting healthcare professionals for medical decisions.
Continuous Model Tuning: If AI summarization is used, regularly retrain or fine-tune models with domain-specific data to improve accuracy. Use smaller controlled models for summarization tasks to avoid the occasional wild misstatements that large models can produce.
Risk 2: Privacy Breach or Perception of Privacy Erosion
Description: Even though COMPASS uses anonymized data, users might worry that their personal supplement usage could be exposed or identifiable in trends. If any security breach occurred leaking user data, or if users simply misunderstand how data is used, trust could be lost.
Mitigation:
Transparency: Be exceedingly clear in onboarding and in the UI about what data is private. For example, tooltips on trend stats can say “This data is aggregated from the anonymous inputs of many users. Your individual data is never shown.” The privacy policy should be succinctly summarized in-app (not just buried in legal text).
Robust Security Measures: Implement top-notch security as detailed in the Privacy & Security section (encryption, RLS, etc.). Conduct regular penetration tests and security audits to catch vulnerabilities. Ensure that any personally identifiable info is stored and transmitted securely.
Minimal Personal Data in Trends: Design trend algorithms to require a threshold of users before displaying something. For instance, don’t show a trending protocol if only 2 people use it (which could potentially make those 2 identifiable). Set thresholds (maybe minimum 10 or 20 users) before something appears in “trending”. This way, a unique regimen by one user won’t suddenly be visible to all as “trending” (which could inadvertently expose that user’s specific behavior).
Incident Response Plan: Have a plan if a breach or issue occurs: immediate user notification, ability for users to change credentials or delete data if needed, etc. Quick, transparent response can mitigate damage.
Consistent Privacy Stance: Resist feature creep that undermines privacy. For example, adding a public leaderboard of top users (like “most supplements logged by userX”) would violate our principles, so we avoid that. Maintaining a hard line on privacy helps avoid scenarios that could lead to breaches or user backlash.
Risk 3: Low User Adoption / Engagement
Description: There’s a risk that users might not use COMPASS as expected. Perhaps they find it overwhelming, or they prefer external sources (like Googling) out of habit. If the community is small initially, trending features might seem empty or not useful, creating a poor first impression. Low engagement would reduce the value of the entire platform (and concern investors).
Mitigation:
Seed Content and Trends: In the early days, before a critical mass of user data exists, ensure COMPASS still provides value. This is where editorial content and curated data come in. For example, even with few users, we can manually highlight some known popular supplements or import industry stats to create a “simulated” trending list that’s realistic. Likewise, ensure there are at least a dozen high-quality articles/spotlights to read at launch so it doesn’t feel empty.
Onboarding & Education: Guide new users into COMPASS. For instance, on sign-up, a tutorial might pop up: “Check out COMPASS to see what supplements are trending for your goals.” Possibly even gamify the first use (achievement for doing your first search or reading first article).
Integration in User Journey: Insert COMPASS touchpoints naturally. Example: after a user completes setting up their stack in VANTA Lab, the app could prompt “See how your stack compares to the community in COMPASS.” Or if they log a symptom improvement, prompt relevant content: “Many users who track better sleep use magnesium – learn more on COMPASS.” This cross-feature integration draws users in who might not click it otherwise.
Performance and UX Polish: Ensure using COMPASS is fast and pleasurable. If search was slow or UI cluttered, users won’t bother. We address this with caching and iterative UI testing. Also, be responsive to feedback: if users say the interface is confusing, adjust it. Good UX can markedly improve adoption.
Marketing and Positioning: Externally, highlight COMPASS as a differentiator. Content marketing (like publishing some trend insights on a blog or social media) could draw new users in to use the tool themselves. Within SILO, maybe a periodic push notification or email like “Top new trend this week on COMPASS” can entice existing users to come back and check it out.
Risk 4: Technical Scalability Issues
Description: As the user base grows, COMPASS involves heavy data operations (search across databases, vector computations, etc.). If not scaled properly, users might experience slow responses or downtime. A spike in usage (e.g., if a particular news drives many queries) could overwhelm the system.
Mitigation:
Scalable Architecture: We designed with serverless and caching from the start, which scales automatically to an extent. Continue to use cloud-managed scalable services (Supabase can scale vertically, or we add read replicas). Use autoscaling for any custom services (Kubernetes or similar for microservices if needed).
Performance Testing: Simulate high loads and usage patterns in a staging environment. For instance, test with 10x expected traffic to see where bottlenecks emerge. Optimize query indices, increase cache TTLs, or add distributed caches if necessary. If trending computations become expensive, consider doing more pre-computation offline and storing ready results.
Gradual Rollouts: If a major new feature (like the chat assistant) is resource-intensive, roll it out gradually or behind a feature flag to measure impact. This avoids sudden stress.
Monitoring & Alerting: Implement robust monitoring (APM for function latency, DB monitoring). Set up alerts if query latency or error rates exceed thresholds. This way, the engineering team can respond before users notice widespread issues.
Fallbacks: Ensure the system fails gracefully. If the RAG engine is slow or fails, a fallback might be to show the card minus the AI summary, rather than not show anything. If one part of the system is under heavy load, degrade non-critical features first (e.g., maybe pause real-time updating of a trend counter, or serve slightly stale data from cache) to preserve core functionality.
Risk 5: Regulatory or Legal Challenges
Description: The health and wellness domain can attract regulatory scrutiny. If COMPASS is seen as making health recommendations, there might be regulatory frameworks (like FDA guidance on health apps) to comply with. Also, using user data (even anonymized) in analytics might have unforeseen legal considerations if laws tighten.
Mitigation:
Legal Review & Compliance: Engage legal counsel familiar with digital health to review the product’s wording and features. For example, ensure we include necessary disclaimers like “These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA” on any supplement efficacy descriptions, to comply with supplement marketing rules.
Avoid Medical Device Territory: We should be careful not to cross into “diagnosis or treatment” territory. We frame COMPASS as educational/informational. We also avoid integrating directly with medical records or giving personalized “treatment plans” without appropriate disclaimers. If later we do any disease-specific guidance, we may need to consider FDA’s mobile medical app guidance (but likely we stay on the wellness side which is lower risk).
Adapt to Data Laws: Keep an eye on evolving data privacy laws (like more states adopting laws similar to CCPA, or changes in GDPR interpretations). Our strong privacy stance positions us well, but we might need adjustments (for instance, if a law requires a separate consent for using even anonymized health data in research, we’d implement that).
Content Licensing: For external data we integrate (like research papers or news), ensure we have rights or use only open data. Avoid scraping content that could cause IP issues. Use open APIs or partnership agreements for things like PubMed or news if needed.
Insurance: Consider liability insurance down the line (errors & omissions) to protect the company in case someone claims they were harmed following advice they perceived from COMPASS. Although we have disclaimers, being insured is prudent.
Risk 6: Competition and Differentiation
Description: Competing platforms or large players (like general health apps or supplement retailers) could introduce similar discovery features. If not careful, COMPASS might not differentiate enough or might be overtaken by someone with more data (e.g., Amazon using its sales data to do supplement trends).
Mitigation:
Innovation Speed: Continue to iterate quickly (as seen in roadmap and future enhancements). By the time competitors try to emulate our basic trend feature, we are already ahead with AI integration, personalized insights, etc.
Unique Data and Integrations: SILO’s advantage is the holistic platform – competitor X might have sales data but not the personal outcome data or the community context. We should capitalize on SILO’s integrated pillars: e.g., only SILO can tie trends to actual efficacy tracking (with wearables, etc.), which is a strong differentiator. Emphasize those combined insights in our value prop.
Patents/IP (if applicable): If we develop novel technology (maybe some unique algorithm for trend detection or personalized recommendation), consider protecting it via patents. This is more an investor concern sometimes. Even if not, building a strong brand around trust and intelligence can be a moat (hard to replicate quickly).
Community Loyalty: By fostering a community and personal profiles/history, users are less likely to switch to a new service that doesn’t have their data or peer community. So focusing on user satisfaction and community features indirectly mitigates competition – it creates switching costs due to invested time and trust in our platform.
Risk 7: Data Quality and Bias
Description: The insights are only as good as the data. If the user base is skewed (say mostly young male biohackers), the “trends” may not be broadly applicable, which could mislead others. Or if data is input incorrectly (mistyped supplement names, etc.), it could throw off the analytics.
Mitigation:
Data Cleaning: Continuously refine how data is recorded. For instance, standardize supplement entries (which our Supplement DB does) so if someone types a custom entry “Vit C”, we encourage linking it to the canonical “Vitamin C”. Use the NLP engine to catch likely duplicates or alias entries. Periodically review any free-text entries that might be popular but not recognized, and merge them appropriately.
Communicate Scope: When presenting trends, sometimes contextualize them: e.g., “Among SILO users, X is trending”. As the community grows it will diversify, but early on we avoid over-generalizing to “everyone”.
Bias Mitigation: If we detect that a particular demographic is underrepresented, and if possible, tailor some content to encourage diversity. For example, ensure articles address women’s health, older age groups, etc., to attract those users and balance the data. Internally, be cautious interpreting trends that might actually reflect a niche interest of a small group.
Robust Analytics: Build analytics that can handle outliers. If one or two users log an abnormally large stack (say someone adds 50 supplements), ensure it doesn’t overly skew trending calculations (perhaps trend metrics consider prevalence, not raw counts, or use median usage, etc.). The Analytics Engine should use methods that are less sensitive to single-user anomalies.
Risk 8: Overload and Choice Paralysis
Description: With so much information, users might feel overwhelmed. If COMPASS presents too many options or too much data (especially to new users), they might not take any action or could get confused about what’s right for them.
Mitigation:
Personalization and Filtering: As planned, increasingly tailor the experience so users see more relevant slices of data. For a new user, maybe highlight just a few things (like top 3 supplements for a goal) rather than a huge list. Use gentle nudges: e.g., a wizard could ask their interest and then show a focused subset.
UI Simplification: Possibly implement progressive disclosure – show high-level info first, and let users click to see more details if they want. For example, a supplement card might initially show just a one-line summary and key stat, with a “show more” to reveal full research breakdown. This keeps it digestible.
Education: Incorporate “What does this mean?” links. If a user sees a metric or term they don’t understand (like “HRV” or “embeddings” if we mention something technical), have brief explanations. This reduces confusion.
Feedback on outcomes: To prevent users from trying every trending thing without focus, integrate it with personal goal tracking (which VANTA Lab does). Essentially, encourage a cycle of trying something, measuring results, and adjusting – rather than chasing every shiny object on COMPASS. Educate through content on how to use the trends as guidance, not as a to-do list of everything.


By enumerating these risks and embedding mitigations into our strategy, we increase the likelihood of COMPASS’s success and resilience. It’s not just about building features, but building them responsibly and sustainably. Regular risk assessments will be part of the project management, so as new features or changes come, we re-evaluate if they introduce new risks (for instance, any community feature would prompt a privacy risk review). This vigilant approach helps maintain the precision, trust, and credibility that COMPASS promises to users and stakeholders.


14. Glossary

SILO Platform: The overarching ecosystem combining multiple modules (VANTA Lab, COMPASS, LENS, AEGIS, Dashboard) to provide a comprehensive supplement optimization experience. SILO is not an acronym but a product name symbolizing an integrated solution rather than isolated “silos” of information.
COMPASS: The discovery and trend intelligence layer of SILO. It surfaces trending supplements, protocols, and insights derived from community data and research, guiding users on what to explore (acting as a “compass” for supplement navigation).
VANTA Lab: The personalization and stack optimization engine of SILO. VANTA Lab allows users to build and manage their supplement regimen (“stack”), get personalized suggestions, and track outcomes.
LENS: The evidence and research database module of SILO. LENS contains a library of scientific studies, regulatory info, and provides research summaries and quality scores for ingredients (acting as SILO’s “research lens”).
AEGIS: The brand integrity and quality audit engine of SILO. AEGIS holds information on supplement brands and products, including quality certifications, lab test results, and flags for any compliance or safety issues (think of it as a protective shield or “aegis” for quality).
User Dashboard (Home): The personalized home screen in SILO aggregating a user’s current stack info, adherence, health data, and saved content. It’s the central overview of everything a user is doing on the platform.
Stack (Supplement Stack): A set of supplements that a user takes as a regimen. Often organized by a goal (e.g., “Immune Boost Stack”). It includes dosage and schedule for each supplement. “Protocol” is used interchangeably, though sometimes protocol implies a more prescriptive or shared regimen template.
Protocol Template: A pre-defined supplement stack aimed at a specific outcome, often expert-curated (e.g., “Better Sleep Protocol” with specific supplements and doses). Users can import these templates in VANTA Lab and then customize them.
Supplement Card: The UI component in COMPASS that provides detailed information about a specific supplement (or protocol). It “slides in” with comprehensive data: description, research insights, user stats, related brands, etc. It is interactive, allowing actions like adding the supplement to one’s stack.
Add-to-Stack: A function allowing a user to incorporate a supplement or protocol from COMPASS directly into their personal regimen in VANTA Lab. It streamlines the process of acting on COMPASS discoveries.
Bioavailability: A term referring to the proportion of a nutrient or supplement that enters circulation and is usable by the body. Higher bioavailability means the body can absorb and use more of the substance. COMPASS might mention bioavailability in context of supplement forms (for example, “Magnesium citrate vs magnesium oxide bioavailability”).
COA (Certificate of Analysis): A document from an independent lab confirming what ingredients (and their amounts, purity, etc.) are in a supplement product. AEGIS uses COAs to verify product quality. Brands with available COAs are often seen as higher integrity.
pgvector: A PostgreSQL extension that enables storage and similarity search of high-dimensional vectors. In SILO, pgvector is used to store embedding vectors of text (like study abstracts or supplement descriptions) to facilitate semantic search (finding relevant items by meaning, not just keywords).
Vector Embeddings: Numeric representations of text or data, often used in machine learning to capture semantic meaning. For example, the name and description of a supplement can be turned into a vector such that similar supplements have closer vectors. Used in the RAG engine and search to enable semantic matching.
RAG Engine (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): An AI component that combines information retrieval with natural language generation. It first retrieves relevant data (e.g., study snippets from LENS) and then generates a human-readable summary or answer, typically using an AI model. For COMPASS, RAG generates the quick research summaries on supplement cards, ensuring the output is grounded in actual sources.
NLP Engine: The Natural Language Processing engine in SILO that handles text analysis tasks. It may extract key entities (like supplement names, conditions), evaluate sentiment or study quality from text, and assist in tagging and summarizing content. Essentially, it “reads” and interprets human language for the platform’s needs.
Analytics Engine: A rule-based logic layer that processes user and health data to derive insights. In context of COMPASS, it computes trends, correlations, and benchmarks (e.g., usage percentages, adherence patterns). It’s more deterministic (non-ML) and handles number crunching and simple pattern detection.
Edge Functions: Serverless function instances that run on the network edge (closer to end-users). Supabase Edge Functions are used to implement custom backend logic like the search API. They scale automatically and provide low-latency responses to users in different regions.
Redis: An in-memory data store often used for caching. In COMPASS’s architecture, Redis (or an equivalent Edge Key-Value store) caches the results of expensive operations (like fully composed supplement cards) for quick reuse.
GraphQL: An API query language and runtime that allows clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request. The COMPASS backend composes data from various sources into a GraphQL schema (for example, a supplementCard type), so the front-end can fetch multiple fields across databases with one query. GraphQL ensures type consistency and reduces over-fetching of data.
RLS (Row-Level Security): A database feature that restricts table rows access based on the executing user. Used in Supabase/Postgres to ensure each user can only query their own data rows (or certain aggregated public rows). It’s a critical part of SILO’s security model.
GDPR / CCPA: General Data Protection Regulation (EU law) and California Consumer Privacy Act (California law), respectively. These are data protection regulations that SILO complies with by giving users control over their data and maintaining transparency in data usage.
HRV: Heart Rate Variability, a measure of variations in time between heartbeats. It’s often tracked with wearables as an indicator of recovery or stress. Mentioned in context of correlating supplement use with health metrics. Not directly a COMPASS metric, but within platform glossary for completeness.
API: Application Programming Interface. In this document, refers to the backend endpoints that the front-end calls. COMPASS has APIs like the search API, content fetch APIs, etc., which allow retrieval of data from the server.
MVP: Minimum Viable Product. The initial version of the product with core features (Phase 1 in the roadmap), sufficient to launch and start getting user feedback.
Phase 1/2/3: The staged development plan for the SILO platform in roughly 3 increments:
Phase 1: Core MVP (basic features for launch at ~3 months).
Phase 2: Added intelligence & integrations (by ~6 months).
Phase 3: Advanced AI features & premium readiness (by ~7-8 months). These terms were used to structure the roadmap development.
Public Launch: Refers to the point at end of Phase 3 when the web platform is released to the general public (non-beta). Before this, testing or beta phases might be semi-public or invite-only.


This glossary covers the specialized terms and abbreviations used throughout the specification. It should help readers (whether investors, engineers, or domain experts) quickly reference what each term means in the SILO/COMPASS context without ambiguity.
