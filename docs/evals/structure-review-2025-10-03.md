---

## ⚠️ Minor Issues to Address

### 1. Root-Level Cleanup

**Issue:** Old `src/ai/` directory still exists
```bash
❌ src/ai/                   # Should be removed or moved
```

**Fix:**
```bash
# Move to platform or delete if already copied
rm -rf src/
```

### 2. TypeScript Config

**Issue:** `tsconfig.json` includes `apps/web/*` in paths (line 13)
```json
"@/*": [
  "apps/landing/src/*",
  "apps/platform/src/*",
  "apps/web/src/*"          // ❌ apps/web doesn't exist
]
```

**Fix:**
```json
"@/*": [
  "apps/landing/src/*",
  "apps/platform/src/*"
]
```

### 3. Empty Package Directories

**Issue:** New packages are empty scaffolds
```
⚠️ packages/ai/              # Empty - needs package.json
⚠️ packages/database/        # Empty - needs package.json
⚠️ packages/analytics/       # Empty - needs package.json
```

**Fix:** These are fine as placeholders, but should be initialized when ready:
```bash
# When ready to use:
cd packages/ai
pnpm init
# Add package.json with proper config
```

### 4. Documentation Files

**Issue:** Empty placeholder docs in guides
```
⚠️ docs/guides/development.md    # Empty (0 bytes)
⚠️ docs/guides/deployment.md     # Empty (0 bytes)
⚠️ docs/guides/contributing.md   # Empty (0 bytes)
```

**Action:** These are fine as placeholders - populate when ready.

### 5. Root package.json Dependencies

**Issue:** Questionable dependencies at root
```json
"dependencies": {
  "openai": "^4.77.0",
  "pip": "^0.0.1",          // ❌ Probably should be in platform
  "python3": "^0.0.1"       // ❌ Probably should be in platform
}
```

**Recommendation:** Move app-specific deps to respective apps, keep only shared dev tools at root.
